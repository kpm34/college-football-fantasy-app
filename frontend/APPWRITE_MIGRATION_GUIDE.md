- âœ… **Maintain functionality** - All features work after migration
- âœ… **Update credentials** - New project ID and API keys
- âœ… **Test thoroughly** - Verify everything works
- âœ… **Keep backup** - Old project as safety net

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Current Environment Assessment
```bash
# Check current Appwrite configuration
get_current_appwrite_info

# Check migration readiness
check_migration_readiness
```

### 2. Data Backup
```bash
# Create comprehensive backup
generate_migration_scripts scriptType="backup"

# Export all data
generate_migration_scripts scriptType="export"
```

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Migration Process

### Step 1: Create New Project in Kash Organization

1. **Go to Appwrite Console**
   - Visit: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console
   - Navigate to your "Kash" organization

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "Create Project"
   - Name: `college-football-fantasy-app`
   - Description: `College Football Fantasy App - Power 4 Conferences`

3. **Generate API Key**
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ API Keys
   - Create new API key with full access
   - Copy the Project ID and API Key

### Step 2: Set Up Database Structure

```bash
# Generate setup script
generate_migration_scripts scriptType="setup"
```

**Manual Setup (if needed):**

1. **Create Database**
   - Database ID: `fantasy_football_db`
   - Name: `Fantasy Football Database`

2. **Create Collections**
   - `games` - Game data and scores
   - `rankings` - AP Top 25 rankings
   - `teams` - Power 4 team information
   - `players` - Player data and stats
   - `leagues` - User leagues
   - `rosters` - Team rosters
   - `lineups` - Weekly lineups

### Step 3: Export Data from Current Project

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Export script for College Football Fantasy App data
echo "ðŸ“¤ Exporting data from current project..."

CURRENT_PROJECT_ID="${process.env.APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID}"
EXPORT_DIR="./data-export-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

mkdir -p $EXPORT_DIR

# Export specific collections
collections=("games" "rankings" "teams" "players" "leagues" "rosters" "lineups")

for collection in "${collections[@]}"; do
  echo "Exporting collection: $collection"
  curl -X GET "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/databases/$CURRENT_PROJECT_ID/collections/$collection/documents" \
    -H "X-Appwrite-Project: $CURRENT_PROJECT_ID" \
    -H "X-Appwrite-Key: ${process.env.APPWRITE_API_KEY}" \
    -o "$EXPORT_DIR/$collection.json"
done

echo "âœ… Export completed: $EXPORT_DIR"
```

### Step 4: Import Data to New Project

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Import script for College Football Fantasy App data
echo "ðŸ“¥ Importing data to new Kash project..."

NEW_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID"
NEW_API_KEY="YOUR_NEW_API_KEY"
IMPORT_DIR="./data-export-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Import collections
collections=("games" "rankings" "teams" "players" "leagues" "rosters" "lineups")

for collection in "${collections[@]}"; do
  echo "Importing collection: $collection"
  if [ -f "$IMPORT_DIR/$collection.json" ]; then
    # Create collection first
    curl -X POST "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/databases/$NEW_PROJECT_ID/collections" \
      -H "X-Appwrite-Project: $NEW_PROJECT_ID" \
      -H "X-Appwrite-Key: $NEW_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "collectionId": "'$collection'",
        "name": "'$collection'",
        "permissions": ["read(\"*\")", "write(\"*\")"]
      }'
    
    # Import documents
    jq -c '.documents[]' "$IMPORT_DIR/$collection.json" | while read -r document; do
      curl -X POST "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/databases/$NEW_PROJECT_ID/collections/$collection/documents" \
        -H "X-Appwrite-Project: $NEW_PROJECT_ID" \
        -H "X-Appwrite-Key: $NEW_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "$document"
    done
  fi
done

echo "âœ… Import completed"
```

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables

Use the MCP tool to generate updated environment variables:

```bash
update_env_variables newProjectId="YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID" newApiKey="YOUR_NEW_API_KEY"
```

**New Environment Variables:**
```env
# Appwrite Configuration for Kash Organization
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID
APPWRITE_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_API_KEY
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=fantasy_football_db

# Vercel Configuration
VERCEL_URL=https://college-football-fantasy-app.vercel.app
VERCEL_ENV=production

# AI Gateway (if using)
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_ai_gateway_key_here

# Other configurations
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=https://college-football-fantasy-app.vercel.app
```

### Step 6: Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `college-football-fantasy-app`

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Update the following variables:
     - `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` â†’ New Project ID
     - `APPWRITE_API_KEY` â†’ New API Key
     - `APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` â†’ `fantasy_football_db`

3. **Redeploy**
   - Trigger a new deployment to apply changes

### Step 7: Test All Functionality

```bash
# Test new project
generate_migration_scripts scriptType="test"

# Monitor website features
monitor_page_features features=["team-colors", "conference-showcase", "draft-system"]

# Check website status
get_website_status
```

**Test Checklist:**
- âœ… **Team Colors**: Verify team colors display correctly
- âœ… **Conference Showcase**: Check conference pages load
- âœ… **API Endpoints**: Test all API routes work
- âœ… **Database Connection**: Verify data is accessible
- âœ… **Draft System**: Test draft functionality
- âœ… **Auction System**: Test auction functionality

### Step 8: Verify Data Integrity

```bash
# Compare versions
compare_versions

# Get website snapshot
get_website_snapshot includeHtml=true
```

## ðŸ”’ Safety Measures

### 1. Backup Strategy
- **Before Migration**: Full backup of current project
- **During Migration**: Keep old project as backup
- **After Migration**: Verify all data transferred correctly

### 2. Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert environment variables to old project
2. Trigger new Vercel deployment
3. Verify old project still works
4. Debug issues before retrying migration

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Staging Test**: Test with new project before switching
- **Feature Testing**: Verify all features work
- **Data Validation**: Ensure no data loss
- **Performance Check**: Verify performance is maintained

## ðŸ“Š Migration Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor migration progress
get_website_status

# Check feature status
monitor_page_features

# Verify data integrity
get_current_appwrite_info
```

### Success Indicators
- âœ… Website loads without errors
- âœ… All API endpoints return data
- âœ… Team colors display correctly
- âœ… Conference showcase works
- âœ… Draft and auction systems function
- âœ… No console errors
- âœ… Performance maintained

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   ```bash

   curl -X GET "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/databases" \
     -H "X-Appwrite-Project: YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "X-Appwrite-Key: YOUR_NEW_API_KEY"
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Test database connection
   curl -X GET "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/databases/fantasy_football_db/collections" \
     -H "X-Appwrite-Project: YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "X-Appwrite-Key: YOUR_NEW_API_KEY"
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - Check Vercel environment variables are updated
   - Verify deployment completed successfully
   - Clear browser cache and test again

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Revert to old project
# Update environment variables back to old project
# Redeploy to Vercel
# Test functionality
# Debug issues before retrying
```
