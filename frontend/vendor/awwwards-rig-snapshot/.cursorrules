# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Project Context
You are working on an Awwwards-style Next.js 15 application with React Three Fiber for 3D graphics.

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use async/await over promises
- Follow existing file structure patterns
- Keep components small and focused
- Use descriptive variable names

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize WebGL/Three.js performance first
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Minimize re-renders with useMemo/useCallback
- Lazy load heavy components

## Three.js/R3F Best Practices
- Use instancing for repeated geometries
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) where appropriate
- Dispose of geometries and materials properly
- Use texture compression (KTX2, Basis)
- Limit draw calls and polygon count

## Next.js Specific
- Use App Router patterns (not Pages Router)
- Implement proper metadata and SEO
- Use dynamic imports for client-only code
- Leverage ISR/SSG where possible
- Keep API routes lightweight

## Testing & Quality
- Write TypeScript types for all props
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Test responsive design across viewports
- Check performance metrics regularly

## Common Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Development server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run typecheck  # Type checking
npm run lint:fix   # Fix linting issues
npm run preview    # Vercel preview
npm run deploy     # Production deploy
```

## File Locations
- Components: src/app/[route]/
- 3D Scene: src/app/scene/
- API Routes: src/app/api/
- Hooks: src/hooks/
- Types: Create as needed
- Assets: public/models/, public/textures/

## DO NOT
- Create files unless necessary
- Add console.logs in production code
- Ignore TypeScript errors
- Skip performance considerations
- Use deprecated patterns

## ALWAYS
- Check existing patterns first
- Consider mobile performance
- Handle loading and error states
- Clean up subscriptions/listeners
- Update MEMORY folder for significant changes
