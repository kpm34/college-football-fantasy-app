/**
 * ‚ùå DEPRECATED ENDPOINT - REMOVED
 * 
 * This endpoint has been removed as of August 17, 2025.
 * It used outdated projection calculations without proper depth chart multipliers.
 * 
 * üîÑ MIGRATION GUIDE:
 * 
 * Old usage: /api/projections?position=QB&conference=SEC
 * New usage: /api/draft/players?position=QB&conference=SEC&orderBy=projection
 * 
 * Enhanced endpoints with depth chart logic:
 * - /api/draft/players - Draft-ready players with enhanced projections
 * - /api/players/cached - Cached player data with projections
 * 
 * Key improvements in new endpoints:
 * - ‚úÖ Depth chart multipliers (starters vs backups)
 * - ‚úÖ Enhanced QB differentiation (QB1: ~340pts, QB2: ~85pts)  
 * - ‚úÖ Team-specific pace and role adjustments
 * - ‚úÖ Conference strength modifiers
