# 🏗️ Complete Infrastructure Implementation

## 🎯 What We Built

A **comprehensive Appwrite infrastructure system** that handles permissions, indexes, functions, and storage with full contract test coverage.

## ✅ Components Implemented

### 1. Permission System (`schema/permissions.ts`)
- **Role-based Access Control**: guest/user/commissioner/admin/system hierarchy
- **Ownership Rules**: Users can only modify resources they own
- **Membership Rules**: League members can access league resources  
- **Conditional Permissions**: Status-based access (e.g., can't delete active leagues)
- **Custom Logic**: Commissioner access, lineup locking, roster modification windows

```typescript
// Example: Roster permissions
rosters: {
  ownershipField: 'userId',
  membershipField: 'leagueId',
  rules: [
    { role: 'user', actions: ['read'], conditions: { membership: true } },
    { role: 'user', actions: ['create', 'update'], conditions: { ownership: true } },
    { role: 'user', actions: ['read'], conditions: { custom: 'league_commissioner' } }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Performance Indexes (`schema/indexes.ts`)
- **Compound Indexes**: Multi-field indexes for complex queries
- **Query Optimization**: Indexes designed for actual usage patterns
- **Priority System**: High/medium/low priority for deployment order
- **Performance Analysis**: Query pattern matching and optimization suggestions

**Key Indexes:**
- `draft_availability_idx`: `[eligible, position, fantasy_points DESC]` - 🔥 **High Priority**
- `league_standings_idx`: `[leagueId, wins DESC, pointsFor DESC]` - 🔥 **High Priority** 
- `conference_rankings_idx`: `[conference, position, fantasy_points DESC]` - 🔥 **High Priority**
- `weekly_schedule_idx`: `[season DESC, week ASC, start_date ASC]` - 🔥 **High Priority**

### 3. Serverless Functions (`schema/functions.ts`)
- **Data Sync Functions**: Import player data, game scores from APIs
- **Fantasy Scoring**: Real-time fantasy point calculations
- **Draft Management**: Auto-draft, auction bidding, notifications
- **Maintenance**: Cleanup, backups, monitoring

**Critical Functions:**
- `sync-game-scores` - Updates scores every 10 minutes during games
- `calculate-fantasy-scores` - Triggers on player stats updates
- `process-auction-bid` - Handles auction bidding logic
- `auto-draft-pick` - Makes picks when draft timers expire

### 4. Storage Buckets (`schema/storage.ts`)
- **User Content**: Avatars, team logos with public read access
- **System Assets**: Player photos, team logos with admin-only write
- **Data Management**: Import/export files with encryption
- **File Policies**: Size limits, type validation, antivirus scanning

**Bucket Categories:**
- **User Content** (public): `user-avatars`, `team-logos`
- **System Assets** (restricted): `player-photos`, `team-assets` 
- **Data Files** (encrypted): `data-imports`, `league-exports`
- **Temporary** (auto-cleanup): `draft-uploads`, `error-logs`

### 5. Helper Utilities (`core/helpers/schema-helpers.ts`)
- **PermissionHelper**: Convert schema to Appwrite permissions
- **IndexHelper**: Query optimization and performance analysis
- **FunctionHelper**: Deployment ordering and validation
- **StorageHelper**: File upload validation and quota management

### 6. Comprehensive Sync Script (`scripts/sync-appwrite-complete.ts`)
- Syncs all infrastructure components in proper order
- Handles permissions, indexes, functions, and storage
- Validates configuration before deployment
- Provides detailed deployment feedback

## 🚀 Usage Commands

### Schema Management
```bash
# Simple sync (basic collections)
npm run schema:sync-simple

# Complete infrastructure sync
npm run schema:sync-complete

# Validate all schemas
npm run schema:validate
```

### Contract Testing
```bash
# Test schema compliance
npm run test:schema

# Test full infrastructure
npm run test:infrastructure  

# Run all contract tests
npm run test:contracts
```

### Infrastructure Management
```bash
# Run migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed development data  
npm run seed
```

## 🛡️ Contract Test Coverage

### Schema Tests (`tests/schema.contract.test.ts`)
✅ Collection existence and naming  
✅ Attribute types and constraints  
✅ Index presence and performance  
✅ Data consistency validation

### Infrastructure Tests (`tests/infrastructure.contract.test.ts`)
✅ **Permission System**: Role-based access, ownership rules  
✅ **Performance Indexes**: Compound indexes, query optimization  
✅ **Storage Buckets**: File policies, size limits, permissions  
✅ **Serverless Functions**: Runtime configs, cron schedules  
✅ **System Integration**: Cross-component consistency

## 🔒 Security Features

### Role-Based Permissions
- **Guest**: Read-only access to public data (players, games, rankings)
- **User**: Manage own resources (rosters, lineups), create leagues
- **Commissioner**: Full access to own leagues and member data
- **Admin**: System administration, data management
- **System**: Function execution, automated processes

### Data Protection
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data (imports, exports, backups)
- **Antivirus Scanning**: User-uploaded files
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed extensions
- **Size Limits**: Prevent abuse with reasonable file size caps
- **Quota Management**: Per-user storage and upload limits

### Access Control
- **Ownership Verification**: Users can only access/modify their own resources
- **League Membership**: Access restricted to league members
- **Status-Based Rules**: Conditional access based on resource state
- **Custom Logic**: Advanced permissions (commissioner access, lineup locking)

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Query Performance
- **Draft Board**: Optimized for `eligible + position + fantasy_points` queries
- **League Standings**: Compound index on `leagueId + wins + pointsFor`
- **Player Search**: Fulltext search with position filtering
- **Game Schedule**: Efficient weekly schedule lookups

### Caching Strategy
- **Repository Level**: Intelligent caching with TTL management
- **Function Level**: Performance monitoring and optimization
- **Storage Level**: CDN-ready bucket configurations

### Scalability
