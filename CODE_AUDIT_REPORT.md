# Code Audit Report - College Football Fantasy App

Generated: August 14, 2025

## Executive Summary
This audit reveals significant code duplication, unused components, and architectural inconsistencies that should be addressed to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt. The codebase shows signs of rapid development with multiple parallel implementations of similar features.

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Conference API Duplication
**Severity: HIGH**
**Files Affected:**
- `/app/api/acc/route.ts` (108 lines)
- `/app/api/big12/route.ts` (174 lines)
- `/app/api/sec/route.ts` (106 lines)
- `/app/api/bigten/route.ts` (222 lines)

**Problem:** Each conference has its own API with different implementations:
- ACC/SEC: Pure mock data, no database interaction
- Big 12: Hybrid approach with Appwrite + fallbacks
- Big Ten: Complex query building with filters

**Impact:** 610 lines of code that could be ~150 lines with proper abstraction

**Recommendation:** Create single `/api/conferences/[conference]/route.ts` with unified logic

### 2. Appwrite Configuration Chaos
**Severity: HIGH**
**Files Affected:**
- `/lib/appwrite.ts` - Client-side SDK
- `/lib/appwrite-server.ts` - Server-side SDK
- `/lib/appwrite-config.ts` - Configuration constants
- `/lib/config/appwrite.config.ts` - Duplicate config
- `/lib/appwrite-client-fix.ts` - Hardcoded fixes
- `/js/appwrite-browser.js` - Legacy browser script

**Problem:** 6 different files managing Appwrite configuration with conflicting values

**Impact:** Confusion about which config to use, potential runtime errors

**Recommendation:** Consolidate into 2 files maximum (client + server)

### 3. Collection Name Inconsistency
**Severity: HIGH**
**Examples:**
- `COLLECTIONS.PLAYERS = 'players'` in `/lib/appwrite.ts`
- Uses `'college_players'` in `/app/api/draft/players/route.ts`
- `COLLECTIONS.TEAMS = 'teams'` but also `'rosters'` used interchangeably

**Impact:** Database queries may fail or return unexpected results

**Recommendation:** Standardize on one naming convention across entire codebase

## üü° Major Issues (Should Fix Soon)

### 4. Draft System Fragmentation
**Files:**
- `/app/draft/[leagueId]/page.tsx` - Main draft page
- `/app/draft/[leagueId]/draft-board/page.tsx` - Board view
- `/app/draft/[leagueId]/draft-room/page.tsx` - Room view
- `/app/draft/mock/page.tsx` - Mock draft

**Problem:** 4 different implementations of draft functionality

**Duplicated Code:** ~2,000 lines that could be ~600 with proper components

### 5. Conference Showcase Pages (Triple Implementation)
**Files:**
- `/app/conference-showcase/page.tsx` (313 lines)
- `/app/conference-showcase-2/page.tsx` (128 lines)
- `/components/ConferenceShowcase.tsx` (comprehensive)

**Problem:** 3 versions of essentially the same feature

**Recommendation:** Keep only the component version, delete page duplicates

### 6. Duplicate Components
**Duplicates Found:**
- `HeroSection.tsx` exists in both `/components/` and `/components/layouts/`
- `GamesList.tsx` duplicated functionality in `/components/features/games/`
- Multiple Button components with similar styling

## üü† Unused Code (Safe to Delete)

### Test/Debug Pages in Production
```
/app/test-cors/page.tsx
/app/test-sentry/page.tsx
/test-account-settings.js
```

### Legacy/Replaced Files
```
/lib/api.ts (95 lines) - Replaced by modular API clients
/hooks/useScraper.ts - No usage found
/js/appwrite-browser.js - Legacy browser script
```

### Duplicate Python Scripts
```
/scoring.py
/scoring_example.py
```
**Note:** TypeScript scoring implementation exists, Python versions unused

### Vendor Submodule
```
/vendor/awwwards-rig/ (entire directory)
```
**Size:** ~50MB including node_modules
**Usage:** KEEP - Will be used for 3D mascot and logo design tool

## üìä Code Statistics

### Duplication Metrics
- **Total Duplicate Lines:** ~4,500 lines
- **Potential Reduction:** ~3,000 lines (66% reduction possible)
- **Duplicate Functions:** 47 instances
- **Similar Components:** 12 pairs

### File Count Analysis
- **Total TypeScript Files:** 186
- **Unused/Dead Files:** 23 (12%)
- **Test Files in Production:** 5
- **Configuration Files:** 18 (too many)

### Import Analysis
