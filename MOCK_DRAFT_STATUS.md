# âœ… Mock Draft Player Selection - Status Report

## Current Implementation Status: **WORKING CORRECTLY** ðŸŽ¯

The mock draft in `/app/draft/mock/page.tsx` is properly handling all player selection requirements:

## 1. âœ… Player Removal from Available Pool

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Line 92: Tracks all drafted players
const [draftedPlayers, setDraftedPlayers] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

// Line 355: Adds selected player to drafted set
setDraftedPlayers(prev => new Set([...prev, player.id]));

// Line 396: Filters out drafted players from display
if (showOnlyAvailable) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(p => !draftedPlayers.has(p.id));
}
```

### Visual Feedback:
- Drafted players shown with 50% opacity when displayed
- "Available" toggle button to show/hide drafted players
- Draft button only appears for available players

## 2. âœ… Adding Players to User's Team

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Line 93: Tracks user's roster
const [myRoster, setMyRoster] = useState<Player[]>([]);

// Line 361-363: Adds to roster when it's user's pick
if (isMyPick) {
  setMyRoster(prev => [...prev, player]);
}
```

### Features:
- User's roster is maintained separately
- Only adds players when it's the user's turn
- Roster persists throughout the draft

## 3. âœ… Advancing to Next Pick

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Line 365: Advances pick counter
setCurrentPick(prev => prev + 1);

// Line 366: Resets timer for next pick
setTimeRemaining(settings.pickTimeSeconds);
```

### Features:
- Automatic pick advancement after selection
- Timer resets for each new pick
- Snake draft order properly maintained

## 4. âœ… Safety Features

### Duplicate Prevention:
```typescript
// Line 350: Prevents drafting already selected players
if (draftedPlayers.has(player.id)) return;
```

### Turn Validation:
```typescript
// Line 735: Draft button only shows when it's user's turn
{!isDrafted && isMyPick && (
  <button onClick={() => draftPlayer(player)}>
    Draft
  </button>
)}
```

## Current Draft Flow:

1. **User clicks "Draft" on a player** â†’ 
2. **System checks if player is available** â†’
3. **Player added to draftedPlayers Set** â†’
4. **If user's turn: Player added to myRoster** â†’
5. **Player marked visually as drafted** â†’
6. **Pick counter advances** â†’
7. **Timer resets** â†’
8. **Next team's turn begins**

## UI/UX Features:

- **Available Players Count**: Shows "X of Y players" 
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Drafted players: 50% opacity
  - Draft button: Only shows for available players on user's turn
  - Current pick indicator
- **Filters**: Can toggle between showing all players or only available
- **Auto-pick**: Timer counts down and auto-picks if time expires

## Testing the Mock Draft:

1. Start a mock draft
2. Select a player when it's your turn
3. Verify:
   - âœ… Player disappears from available list (or shows as drafted)
   - âœ… Player appears in "My Roster" section
   - âœ… Draft advances to next team
   - âœ… Cannot re-draft the same player
   - âœ… Timer resets for next pick

## Summary:

**The mock draft is working exactly as intended!** All three requirements are properly implemented:
- âœ… Selected players are removed from the available pool
- âœ… Selected players are added to the user's team
- âœ… Draft automatically advances to the next pick

No changes needed - the implementation is solid! ðŸŽ‰
