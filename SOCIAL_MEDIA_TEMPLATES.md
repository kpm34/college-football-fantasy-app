Revolutionary College Fantasy Football Platform Launches Just Before Season Kickoff

AI-Powered Platform Fills Massive Gap in Fantasy Sports Market

Key features include:
- AI-powered draft assistant
- Real-time scoring during games
- Power 4 conference focus
- Mobile-first design
- Free-to-play model

"College football fans have been underserved for too long," said [Founder Name]. "We built this platform specifically for the passionate, loyal fanbase that college football deserves."

Early beta users report 95% satisfaction rates and average session times 3x higher than competing platforms.
