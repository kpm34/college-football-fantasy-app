Blessings
It is true that what you desire is a happy life. What you seek is not a
momentary sukha (happiness) – it is an everlasting bubbling happiness
that never dies. You wish to be fearless and egoless. For this, you have the
Shrimad Bhagwat Gita, which is the essence of all our Shastras. The Gita
teaches you the art of rising above all disputes. It teaches you the method
of destroying mental impurities, impurities in your actions, and in your
feelings. It teaches the skill of not letting yourself be destroyed.
In the Gita you get the buddhi-yoga that enables you to attach your
intellect to the Ishwara. It implants subtle subconscious impressions,
called sanskaara. You will ascend step by step into the profound meaning
of Dharma, bhakti, Yoga, and Gnan. Not only that, you will immediately
obtain the fruit of this knowledge.
The Gita is there for your daily life. It is an unfailing boon given by the
Ishwara. Its purpose is to save you from fear, defeat, sorrow and poverty.
This world is filled with suffering. The Gita stands with outstretched arms
to lift you up. Just look once, at your Mother Gita!
It is absolutely certain that if you use the Gita in your daily life, your
sorrow, diffidence and suffering will be removed. Your daivi sampatti (the
wealth of godly qualities) will increase, and aasuri (lowly) tendencies will
die. A glimpse of the great qualities of Bhagwan are bound to influence
your mind. You will obtain godly virtues. This is where the pure stream of
Gnan is. Study and meditate upon the words of Swami Shri Akhandanand
Saraswati, who was an enlightened Saint as well as an acknowledged
authority on our Shastras.
This book is a collection of twenty-seven discourses given by Maharajji in
Mumbai, in 1971. The talks were recorded and transcribed by Smt. Kunti
Dharmachand Jalan and edited by Shri Vishnu. They have been translated
by Smt.Purnima L.Toolsidass and Shri Pankaj Roy has added the Sanskrit
lettering and formatted it as an E-book. My blessings to them all.
Swami Sacchidananda Saraswati

DAINIK JEEVAN MEIN GITA
by
Swami Akhanandnand Saraswati
Pravachan 1.
The Importance of Awakening the Intellect.
One day, a gentleman asked me when the Gita was created. I
responded by asking him a question. Is it more important to know
when something was said, or is it more important to know
whether what is said is true or false? What is important is the truth
of the matter; not whether it was said a few days earlier or a few
days later.
Another gentleman asked, ‘Maharaj, which is the exact
geographical location where the Gita was spoken? Was it told in a
forest or on a mountain, or was it actually told on a battlefield?’ I
explained that none of these things make a difference to the value
of what is said. What is of value is the truth of what is said.
Someone may question further, whether something was said by a
child or an old man. ‘Baalaadapi subhaashitam’ – accept what is
true, even if it is said by a child. Truth is not restricted to the
words of elderly people. Please give up this false impression.
What we should see is whether what is said will prove to be true
under examination or not.
What is said is of value if it is true, regardless of where it was
said, when it was said, by whom it was said, and whichever
language it was said in. If it is established as being true, we will
call it ‘Satya’. Satya is that, which can never be negated.

The department of historians who try to discover at which point of
time something was said – or the origin of what was said – is
different. Historians are in no way connected to the essence of
what is said in the Gita. Let them continue with their research.
Leave it to the experts to decide whether the Gita was spoken at
Kurukshetra or somewhere else. Let the Sanatan Dharmis and
Arya Samajis debate over whether the main speaker was Shri
Krishna or Veda Vyasa (who wrote the Mahabharata, of which the
Gita is a part).
Let us examine whether the things that are said in the Gita touch
our lives or not. Do they help us to resolve the problems we face
in our present lives? Do they remove our sorrow and pain or not?
Does the Gita bestow us with peace and happiness or not? If the
Gita solves our problems, removes our sorrow and pain, and gives
us immediate peace and happiness, it is an amrita grantha (a book
that contains the elixir of immortality), and there is no need to
attach when, where and who to it. It is our antaryaami (the one
who abides in all hearts) Shri Krishna who is giving us this
sermon here and now. It is an injustice to place Shri Krishna in the
past tense. Shri Krishna is not a historical figure – He is the
essence of everything. He was present at that time, He is present
now. It is not fair to give Him a geographical location or restrict
Him to any language, or any religious sect. Shri Krishna belongs
to all of us. He is within us, and knows what is in our heart. The
reins of our life are in his hands. The Gita is spoken by Narayana
(who abides in all hearts) to resolve the problems of the nara
(human being).
People who are more interested in the material world are inclined
towards worldly research. Those who are more interested in
obtaining an experience of the Atma, look at the Atma to discover
the Satya. If the Gita contains a description of Swarga (Heaven),
you will have to believe that Swarga exists. Unless and until you
connect the descriptions of Swarga and Narak (Hell), the point
will not be established. However, if it is the description of some
gross object, you don’t need faith; it can be known by science.

## Page 4

The Gita says that the Paramatma – who is the supreme Satya –
cannot be revealed by fire, the sun, or the moon. You can interpret
this as meaning that the Paramatma cannot be known through the
eyes, mind, or speech. However, where the description of the
Atma is given, the Gita says that to know the pratyaksha (that,
which can be experienced directly) we need neither science nor
shraddhaa (faith). [Shraddha is needed to accept the existence of
things like Heaven, which we cannot know through our senses or
science]. You can immediately experience the description the Gita
gives about yourself, because it is about you, about your own
essence. You can at once find out what you are like – you need
neither science nor faith to know yourself.
Now, listen to something else about the Gita. There are two
methods of the actions done in this world. One method is pravritti
(worldly activity), and the other method is to become aloof from
pravritti and come into nivritti (withdrawing from worldly
activities), and obtain the saakshaatkaara (direct experience) of
the aatma-vastu (the thing called the Atma).
It is one thing to know how we should interact in the world so that
our antahkaran (the fourfold mind or subtle body) is purified, and
our worldly interaction is successful. It is another thing altogether
to know what saadhan (effort for spiritual progress) we should do,
to become fit to get a darshan (vision) of the Paramatma. Both
these have to be created by our own effort.
Worldly people put in an effort and create something. They put in
an effort and gain something. We have to make an effort to make
something new. We have to see which activity will give us which
fruit. Through pravritti you can get the things you want. You can
get wealth, bhoga (sensual indulgences), and Dharma. However,
what does pravritti end in? It ends in nivritti! All activities
conclude in your being established in you Self; in being niviritta
(free of activities).
Take it like this – there is a kriyasheela pravritti (a driving force
that leads you towards worldly activities), and there is a shaanta
pravritti (the driving force that leads you towards actions that
4

---

## Page 5

result in peace). The nivritti of Samadhi breaks, and pravritti
pushes us into worldly activities. That means, pravritti leads to
nivritti, and nivritti leads to pravritti, and this is how the wheel of
the interactive world keeps turning. Our life is a chariot that
moves on these two wheels. The jeevatma (the Atma attached to a
body; an individual) sits on this chariot (the body). The nara has
to sit on this chariot and work in this karmakshe`tra (the field of
actions). However, there is neither pravritti nor nivritti in the
Jeevatma, because he is the asanga (unattached; aloof) saakshee
(witness).
Now, look; up to this point, the matter can be comprehended
without the teaching of Veda-Vedanta. The Vedas and Vedanta
are needed for this saakshee-aatmaa (the Atma that is a mere
observer) to rent asunder the veil of agnaana (that, which is
contrary to Gnan; ignorance), and know the Brahman (the essence
that is the substratum of everything).
Knowing the Brahman is not as important as the removal of
agnan, but this point is not created by doing any sadhana – neither
pravritti nor nivritti. Had it been the result of any effort, it would
end in due course. Any state created by an effort is destroyed,
because everything that is created is destroyed ultimately.
Tattvagnan (the Gnan about the essence of the Brahman) is used
to reveal that, which is siddha (established as the Satya), which is
our Self. When the Gita tells us, ‘This Atma is the Brahman’ –
and we get the experience that the Atma and the Brahman are
indeed one – the greatest benefit is that the one Parabrahm
Paramatma is revealed in everything. We realize that it is He who
is all that exists. This knowledge is not sullied by mental concepts
of good and bad, attachments and aversions, Narak and Swarga,
birth and death, etc. This state is not created; it is the reality. It is
because we don’t know it that it is paroksha (unseen; unknown).
Very well; let us see what we can obtain from the Gita that will
help us in our daily lives.
In the first chapter we see that Duryodhana is on one side, and
Arjuna is on the other side. ‘Duryodhana’ means a selfish person,
5

---

## Page 6

who uses all kinds of tricks and unethical means to obtain wealth.
‘Arjuna’ means a simple, straightforward person who is eager to
obtain Gnan. Both of them come on to the battlefield and examine
their own, and their enemy’s Armies. Duryodhana examines his
own Army and immediately gives the order that everyone should
protect Bhishma Pitamah. War is announced. In his
announcement, Duryodhana also says that all those gathered on
his side are ready to die for him.
‘Madarthe` tyaktajeevitaah’ (1. 9). That means, ‘I should remain
alive and become the King, even if the whole Army is destroyed.’
This is Duryodhana’s viewpoint. Arjuna comes on to the
battlefield. His special feature is that he has a saarathi (the one
who drives the chariot). You would not have read any description
of Duryodhana’s chariot or sarathi at the start of the Gita. I
believe that you would surely be reading the Gita. Can you tell me
what the name of Duryodhana’s sarathi is? To which sarathi did
Duryodhana give the command to drive his chariot on to the
battlefield? There is no mention of his sarathi, or of any command
given to his sarathi, but Arjuna’s chariot and sarathi are described.
When Arjuna comes on to the battlefield, Shri Krishna Himself
does the work of his sarathi. That means, when you undertake the
journey of life, you must have a chariot (body), you must have the
horses (the senses), and you must have a superior sarathi to drive
you. These two – Arjuna and Shri Krishna – are no other; they are
the nara and Narayana. Bhagwan Himself manifests in these two
forms. One is called the jeevatma, and the other is called the
Vishwatma (the Atma of the whole world).
The jeevatma descended to the battlefield, but not alone. He told
Narayana, ‘Please come with me and drive my chariot.’ He gave
this command to Narayana! A person, who makes Narayana the
guiding force of his life when interacting in the world, is
successful. And the one who comes alone is despoiled and
destroyed.
Therefore the first thing for you to do is to see whether you take
Narayana with you when you set out to do something. Before
6

## Page 7

starting any work or going anywhere, take a peep into your heart
and see Narayana seated there. Remember Him, and then do your
work.
We will desist from commenting on today’s important people.
The big businessmen nowadays can manage without remembering
Narayana. They can manage with thinking about black money.
The shoonya vaadi (those who believe that the ultimate reality is a
shoonya – a vacuum) and other great thinkers forget Narayana.
They attain some worldly glory, a small following, some book
learning, and some brightness in the field of sadhana, and they
forget Him, who abides in all hearts.
Duryodhana went to the battlefield. He did not take Narayana
with him, but Arjuna did. I feel that we may forget anything else,
but what we must remember is that this human form, that is
visible, is not a puppet made of flesh and bones and skin. Inside
this body is the Parameshwara who governs all creation; who has
created everything. He is its Master. So, my first representation on
behalf of the Gita is that whatever you do, don’t have the feeling
that you are alone and have no one to help you. Start your work
by making Narayana your companion. Never think that there is no
help for you – Narayana is with you!
Now give your attention to another point. This concerns your
daily life. I would surely have spoken about Malviyaji many times
in the past. He used to say that each time you leave you house on
any work, you should say, ‘Narayana! Narayana! Narayana!
Narayana!’
It is like this – a river or a stream needs to remain connected to its
source, otherwise it dries up. It is the same with the jeeva. The
origin of the jeeva is Narayana – the Parameshwara. If he remains
connected to the Parameshwara when he interacts in the world, he
will retain his powers.
When you retain your relationship with the Parameshwara, three
things will always be with you. One is that the stream of your life
will never become scattered. The second is that your buddhi
(intellectual power) will never be exhausted. You will keep
7

---

## Page 8

getting new inspirations. And the third is that your life will always
be full of joy.
In contrast, if your relationship with the Parameshwara is severed,
the stream of your life will become fragmented, your intellect will
be dulled, and your innate joy will dry up. You will start buying
or borrowing happiness from others. Your life will become
dependent on medicines, your wisdom will become dependent on
books, and your happiness will become dependent on sensual
indulgences. When you see people borrowing life from medicines,
wisdom from books and other people, and happiness from sensual
indulgences, it is a clear indication that their life, wisdom and joy
are detached from their source.
Now, think about another point. What kind of horses – senses –
should we have? Meaning, what should our senses be like? Please
note that there is no description of the horses of Duryodhana’s
chariot. If you study the Mahabharata, you may possibly find
some mention somewhere, but the Gita considers it unnecessary.
The Gita is particular in pointing out that the horses that drove
Arjuna’s chariot were white – ‘Tatah shve`tairhayairyukte`’ (1.
14).
According to the Kathopanishad, ‘Indriyaani hayaanaahuh’ (3. 4)
– the indriya (senses) are the horses. Do your indriyas lead white
lives or black lives? Are they pure or are they sullied? If their
actions are white, they are clean and wholesome, but if they are
black, they are dirty and sullied. White is the color of saatviktaa
(the sattva guna, in which the tendencies are pure). Does sattva
guna abide in your tendencies or not?
This body of yours is the ratha (chariot). The Atma is the rathee
(charioteer). The Bhagwan vaasude`va (who abides in all hearts)
is the saarathee - the intellect that directs your life. He is the
driver of your life’s chariot, in which you are seated, and pulled
by the strength of your senses. So, are your horses white or not?
This concerns your daily life; it is about how you live from day to
day.
8

## Page 9

Do you dip your senses in black paint (symbolizing tamo guna,
the lowly tendencies), or red paint (symbolizing the rajo guna,
mixed tendencies) or white paint? Do you keep your indriyas
white as you go forth in the battlefield of the world? Are you
careful to be drawn only by white indriyas?
Now, take a look at Arjuna’s life. You will see him and Shri
Krishna seated on a ratha. The ratha is your hriday (mind). Your
tiny little ‘I’ abides in it. It is connected to your personal life, and
does its work. Also in it is the ananta (infinite) chaitanya
(consciousness) – the Paramatma. He rules your life without being
attached to the ‘I’ and ‘mine’ in your life. The consciousness in
both Arjuna and Shri Krishna is the same. ‘Satvame`kam dvidhaa
sthitam’. That means, the same sad vastu (the object that is Sat =
pure existence; the Brahman) has manifested as Krishna and
Arjuna.
Take it like this – there is day and there is night, but time the same
in both. Somebody asked a Mahatma, ‘Maharaj was the world
created in daytime or at night?’
‘My son,’ replied the Mahatma, ‘This world was created by the
one who is the father of both day and night!’
‘Ahamasya krishnam ahamarjunam cha – I am Krishna and I am
also Arjuna.’ (I am darkness and I am light.) Day is time and so is
night, but time is neither day nor night. Day and night are
perceptions in time, but they have no real existence. The creator
of this world is also the creator of day and night. So, both Arjuna
and Shri Krishna have the same infinite, eternal, supreme
consciousness.
Let us review what we have discussed. Consider this body to be
the chariot that is to be used for the journey of life. Don’t consider
it to be your ‘I’. Consider the senses to be the horses, and keep
them white; keep them saattvik (having sattva guna). The pragyaa
(right kind of intellect) is the sarathi – the driver of the chariot.
‘Buddhim tu saarathim viddhi’. It should be kept awake and alert.
This is where life begins.

However, paramparaa (traditional practices) surrounds and
oppresses us when we begin to live! What is parampara? It is
avichaara - lack of vichaara (proper thinking). It is the things that
we have never given thought to. We accepted and followed all the
old practices unthinkingly. If jigyaasaa (a desire to know) is not
awoken in a person, he is bound to remain in a rut. When a person
gives thought to things, and wants to understand their purpose, he
develops a thirst for knowledge.
Arjuna saw the world. He saw both kinds of people – good and
bad. He saw the people on his side and those on Duryodhana’s
side. In this world, there are some people who support us, and
some who oppose us. This world cannot go on without duality,
but we should know that the side we are on is the side of good.
Take in one fact about your life – are you loyal to someone
because of your personal relationship, or do you support him
because he stands for what is good and right?
It once happened that two Acharyas (Masters) staked claim to one
gaddi (position). The post was one, but the contenders were two. I
was appealed to by both groups. ‘This Acharya is your own man,
so you should support him,’ said one group. The other group said,
‘This Acharya is more capable, so you should support him.’
Now look at what your antaraatmaa (the Atma within) tells you.
Is your antaratma Arjuna, or is it Duryodhana? This is the test of
your antaratma. If you support someone because of personal
partiality, Duryodhana manifests in your antaratma. If you accept
what is suitable and support the one who deserves to be supported,
Arjuna manifests in your antaratma. Arjuna looked at both sides
and thought about the matter.
Na kaankshate` vijayam krishna na cha raajyam sukhaani cha,
Kim no raajye`na govinda kim bhogairjeevite`na vaa.
(1. 32)
(O Krishna! I want neither victory, nor the kingdom, nor luxuries
for myself. O Govind! What need have I for such a kingdom and
luxuries, or even such a life?)
10

---

## Page 11

Na kaankshate` vijayam krishna – I don’t want victory. Na cha
raajyam sukhaani cha – I don’t want the kingdom or the luxuries
(at the cost of the death of my dear ones).
‘Arjuna, why have you developed an aversion for life?’
Ye`shaamarthe` kaankshitam no raajyam bhogaah sukhaani cha,
Ta ime`vasthitaa yuddhe` praanaanstyaktvaa dhanaani cha.
(1. 33)
(Those for whose sake I want the kingdom, luxuries and
happiness are standing ready to die, sacrificing their wealth.)
‘I do not want the kingdom, luxuries and happiness for myself. I
want these things for them. I do not wish to live at the cost of
killing so many people.’
Examine yourself. When you do something, is it with the thought
of your personal happiness and benefit, or do you want the good
of all? Arjuna says he wants nothing for his own pleasure, benefit
or advantage. He wants all these for others.
Duryodhana says that all the people on his side are prepared to die
for him, and Arjuna says he is ready to die for the people on his
side.
‘I am ready to give up my life for them,’ is the true path of life,
and, ‘let everyone else die so that I can live and be the king’ is the
wrong path. The name of the former path is the ‘daivee sampatti’
(the wealth of divine qualities) and the name of the latter is
‘aasuree sampatti’ (the wealth of demoniac qualities).
Inculcate some of the Gita’s vive`ka (discrimination) into your
life. Learn something from the Gita. See whether the battle of
your life is for establishing your individual ego, or is it for
establishing the happiness of all. This is the foundation of the
Gita. Make an effort to bring it into your life.
Vivek arose in Arjuna’s life. It is not right to jump into action
impulsively, deciding to do this, or fight with someone, or suffer
for something. The Gita gives you a vision. Obtain it.
11

## Page 12

What is the purpose of your sadhana? Is it to make Satya a
shoonya? Is it to turn aananda (happiness) into dukha (sorrow)?
Do you make an effort for spiritual progress in order to merge into
the parichhinna (fragmented)? And, if you do not know what
consequences your sadhana will have, what sadhana will you do,
anyway?
Therefore, what the Gita says is that discrimination must be
awoken before you begin your sadhana. No other religious text in
the world gives as must respect to the intellect and to Gnan as the
Gita. I say this with full authority. Every morning we wake up and
invoke buddhi and me`dhaa (right thinking) –
me`dhaapraatarhavaamahe`.’ The Gita repeatedly emphasizes the
importance of buddhi.
Yajgyaatvaa ne`ha bhooyonyajgyaatavyamavashishyate`.
(7. 2)
(Once you obtain this Gnan there is nothing more that you need to
know.)
* * * *
Yajgyaatvaa na punarmohame`vam yaasyasi paandava.
(4. 35)
(O Arjuna! Once you have this Gnan delusion will not confuse
you.)
* * * *
Na hi gnaane`na sadrisham pavitramiha vidyate`.
(4. 38)
(There is no doubt that nothing else in the world purifies us as
Gnan does.)
If you want to purify yourself, take the support of Gnan. If you
want to dispel moha (delusion; faulty thinking), take the support
of Gnan. If you want to remove your agnaana (ignorance; that,
which is contrary to Gnan), take the support of Gnan. Do
12

---

## Page 13

whatever you want, but first understand what it entails. Don’t do
anything unthinkingly. This is what the Gita says. The Gita gives
immense respect to Gnan.
Buddhiyogamupaashritya macchittah satatam bhava.
(18. 57)
(Supported by Gnan, let Me be the object of all your mental
inclinations.)
Buddhi yukto jahaateeha ubhe` sukritadushkrite`.
(2. 50)
(A person who is intellectually perfectly balanced gives up both
paapa and punya in this world.)
The Gita never tells us to stop thinking. In fact, the Gita tells us
that if buddhi comes into our life, we can become free of sin and
spiritual merit. It is because of (faulty) buddhi that you get trapped
in paapa-punya. If you get (pure) buddhi you can be liberated
from the cycle of birth and death. This is what the Gita tells us.
Karmajam buddhiyuktaa hi falam tyaktvaa maneeshinah,
Janmabandhavinirmuktaah padam gachhantyanaamayam.
(3. 51)
(A Gnani whose intellect has attained equanimity gives up the
desire for the fruits of karmas, and is liberated from the bondage
of rebirth. He attains the nirvikaara paramapada - the immutable
state of supreme bliss.)
I do not want you to go into a state where the buddhi is destroyed.
I say, ‘May pure buddhi awaken in you.’ Once you obtain the pure
intellect you will lose your fear of birth and death. All the desires
in your mind – for the fruits of your actions – will fade away. Pure
intellect will give you shaanti (peace). If you get pure intellect, all
your doubts and fears will be removed. So much so, that if you get
true buddhi you can get Bhagwan.
Dadaami buddhiyogam tam ye`na maamupayaanti te`.
13

## Page 14

(10. 10)
(I give them the buddhi that enables them to obtain Me.)
The Gita is a book that has great respect for buddhi and Gnan. It
says that you need buddhi to do karmas, you need buddhi to
overcome your false beliefs, you need buddhi to obtain bhakti and
you need buddhi to get the direct experience of the Paramatma.
No other book in the world gives as much importance to buddhi as
the Gita. People may say that all Dharmas are equal, and discuss
the common principles, but I can tell you with authority that there
is no book, of any majhab (religious sect) started by an Acharya
or individual, that states that buddhi is of paramount importance.
They all say that what is written in their book is the Truth.
When any Acharya starts a religion, he says, ‘Have faith in what I
say. Have faith in my book. Do what I tell you to do.’ The Gita
says, ‘Buddhi! Buddhi!! Buddhi!!! Gnan! Gnan!! Gnan!!!’ It is
only through Gnan that you get amrita (the elixir that bestows
immortality). It is only through Gnan that a person obtains the
direct experience of Satya.
Apart from the Gita, there is no other book that removes the
follies of our daily lives, our sorrows, our fear of death and
rebirth, and our regrets and delusions.
Now, every day I will tell you what is given in each chapter, and
describe the things that need to be brought into our lives.

Pravachan II
Arjuna tells Shri Krishna to drive his chariot to a spot between the
two armies. There are two points here that should be noted. One is
that to place the chariot in-between both armies, means having
equanimity towards both sides. The second point is to have the
capacity of Satya to be able to give a command to the Ishwara.
People tell the Ishwara, ‘I will obey Your command,’ and Arjuna
tells the Ishwara, ‘Take my chariot to a point in between both
armies.’ He does not tell Shri Krishna to drive across; he wants
the chariot to be stopped at a place where he can see both the
armies gathered there. The most amazing point is that Bhagwan
does what Arjuna tells Him to do! The one who gives the
command is the jeeva and the one who obeys is Bhagwan!
Don’t you feel tempted to have bhakti for such an obedient
Bhagwan? Even an ordinary person has the desire that Bhagwan
should give up His bhagavattaa (characteristic of being the
Bhagwan) and give fatherly love to the jeeva. Why shouldn’t we
feel love for a Bhagwan who works like an unpaid servant? See
how Bhagwan is doing the work of a driver for Arjuna. He does
not drive the chariot at His own whim; Arjuna tells Him where to
go, and Bhagwan obeys.
Let us see when vive`k (discrimination) rises in our life. It is seen
that vivek does not arise unless samataa (equanimity; equipoise)
is in the mind. The vivek of partiality is not vivek at all; it is faulty
reasoning. When we use our discrimination to justify our selfish
desires – the desires may be related to our religious beliefs,
personal preferences, or political loyalties – it is not real vivek. It
is a kutarka (faulty argument). Just as lawyers argue in favor of
their clients, even if the client is guilty, the buddhi argues in favor
of the desire. The pleasure of fulfilled desires is the fee of the
buddhi! That is not genuine discrimination. It is a misuse of
dialectics; it is kutark.
15

## Page 16

People decide to do something and then give reasons to justify
what they want to do. A lady wants to buy a new sari, so she gives
the excuse of a relative’s wedding to justify it. She talks about
who all will be there and how her image requires that she be
dressed in the latest fashion! The wish for the sari rose first, and
the reasons came later, to justify the fulfillment of the wish.
People want to eat something, and point out how good it is for
health! The buddhi is used to advocate the fulfilling of
inclinations. That is not vivek; that is not vichaara (intellectual
discrimination). The buddhi that follows desire goes on the wrong
path.
When Arjuna tells Shri Krishna to take his chariot to a point in the
middle of both armies, he has vivek. ‘Let me see who the people
that I am to fight are.’
Yaavade`taanireekshe`ham yoddhukaamaanavasthitaan,
Kairmayaa saha yoddhavyamasminranasamudyame`.
(1.22)
(Please stop the chariot here, until I take a good look at all the
warriors standing here ready for war. I wish to see who my
opponents are.)
This is something that is useful in our daily lives. We should use
discretion in whatever we do, and not allow ourselves to be driven
by desires. We should examine the situation with a balanced
attitude towards the fulfillment, and the giving up of desires.
Sahasaa vidadheeta na kriyaam avive`kah paramaapadam.
Nothing should be done impulsively. Due consideration should be
given to what we want to do. The result of thoughtless action is to
have to face adverse and unpleasant consequences.
I will tell you a principle of the Gita. This is a principle that is
shared by all our Shastras. The principle is that all the impurities
in our life should be wiped away. Our life should become clean

and su-sanskrita (having good sanskaras). The real purpose of the
Shastras is to make us pure and ethical; to make us susanskrita.
To be sanskrita (having auspicious habits and tendencies;
cultured; refined) is like getting a hair cut if our hair has grown
like a hippie’s. It means getting a shave if the beard is overgrown
and untidy. This is why our Shastra has the mundan sanskaara
(the ritual of shaving the head of a little child before he gets
regular hair cuts.) So, sanskaras means to cleanse and beautify
something that is dirty, unkempt or improper. This is understood
by both men and women. Sanskara means to do things that
enhance the beauty of our life. Don’t you want your life to
become more beautiful? You are a human being; it is not proper
for you to want to be like an animal. Sanskaras (refinement) is
essential for living a cultured life. Our Indian tradition contains
even the garbhaadhaana sanskaara (a ritual when the seed is
implanted in the womb).
What I want to say about sanskaras is that all our Shastras have
the purpose of inculcating some or other sanskaras in out life. The
Gita also gives sanskaras to our life. Nowadays, people are
disinclined to study any subject by the traditional method. They
read some newspaper article, hear some discourse, and go through
some booklet, and try to understand Dharma. The Shastra is a
treasure house of Dharma. People are reluctant to study or teach
the Shastras. This is why I am telling you the essence of our
Shastras.
There are three kinds of sanskaras – doshaapanayana,
gunaadhaana, and heenaagapoorti. Don’t let the names frighten
you! Doshapanayana means removing the dosha (faults). A dosha
is that, which brings sorrow into our life, and to others’ lives. For
example, if I say something to you that sullies my mind and
tongue, and pains me to say, it is a dosha. The words enter your
mind through your ears and cause pain to you. Any action that
creates envy, disgust, sorrow, etc is a dosha. So, the method of
understanding and removing doshas that become causes of sorrow
is called ‘doshaapanayana’. This is the method for removing our
17

## Page 18

faults. I am telling you this, as a teacher would explain things to
children in a primary school. You are all adults, but the matter is
understood more easily when it is simplified. Were I to use
technical terms, you would find it difficult to grasp.
Gunaadhaana is the aadhaana – implanting – of guna; good
qualities. We need to inculcate into our life the qualities that
create happiness in our own and in other people’s lives. The gunee
(those who have good qualities) reveal their gunas, bringing
happiness for others and for themselves. Therefore, gunadhana is
to bring into our lives those qualities that create happiness for us
and for others.
The third sanskaras is heenaangapoorti. Heenataa is the feeling of
inadequacy; that something is lacking. We feel sad that we lack
certain virtues and have doshas. We feel happy when we have
gunas. However, there is something that neither causes sorrow
like doshas, nor happiness like gunas. Yet it is essential to have in
our life, to experience poornataa (being complete). To bring what
we lack in our life, is called ‘heenaangapoorti’.
Consider it like this – if there is a boil on your body and you have
it removed surgically, that is doshapanayana. If you apply some
cream to hide a blemish, that is gunadhana. And, if you have a
limb missing, and get an artificial limb, that is heenangapurti.
These are the three kinds of sanskaras defined by our Shastras.
I now want to tell you how the Gita gives sanskaras to our entire
life and also to our daily life. Every day we chant, ‘Shamno mitra’
without understanding what it means. The meaning of this shloka
(Vedic verse) is, ‘May the day give us sukha-shaanti (happiness
and peace).’ ‘Sham varunah – may the night give us sukha-shanti.
Shamno bhavatyaryamaa – may we have sukha-shanti in the day
and at night.’ We chant this prayer every day. Our hand is Indra
(the Devta of action). May we get sukha-shanti from our actions.
‘Sham no vishnururukramah – may we get sukha -shanti wherever
we go.’
I will repeat this. Sham no mitra means the Devta (presiding
deity) of the day. Sham varunah means the Devta of night. Sham
18

---

## Page 19

no bhavatyaryamaa means both Devtas. Sham no indra means the
Devta of the hand; vrihaspati – the Devta of speech; vishnuh – the
Devta of the legs. Let all these, and all the actions done by their
power, bring us happiness and peace. That means, we pray every
day for a happy and peaceful life.
Now, see how the Gita brings sanskaras into our life, how it
improves and beautifies our life. Just as a mother scrubs and
bathes her child, combs his hair, and dresses him up nicely, the
Gita cleanses and beautifies our life. The Gita is our mother. A
mother dies, but the Gita doesn’t die. A mother makes mistakes,
but the Gita doesn’t make mistakes. The Gita is our true mother,
who makes our life pure and lovely.
Very well; now let us take a look at the four doshas in our lives
for which sanskaras are needed. It is because of these four kinds
of doshas that sorrows come into our life. Our happiness is
reduced, and we get a feeling of heenataa (inadequacy). So, our
purpose is to remove these doshas and do the adhaana sanskaara
(the sanskaras that implant) the opposite gunas into our life. Our
purpose is to enhance our life through these actions.
One day I was going somewhere, when a man I knew waylaid me.
‘Wait, Swamiji!’ he said. ‘Why, what is the matter?’ I asked.
‘You have worn your sweater inside-out. Let me reverse it.’ So,
what does mother Gita do? She reverses the sweater we wear
inside-out. What is this sweater that is inside-out? It is the
abhinive`sha we have for our body.
Abhinive`sha means becoming so completely nivishtha
(immersed) in something that you can’t find the way to get out. It
means to be imprisoned without realizing that you are in a prison.
When someone says that you have become abhinivishtha in your
body, the meaning is perfectly clear. It means that you identify
with your gross physical form made of bones, flesh, skin, stool,
urine, puss and blood. You think that your body is you. Through
what process of reasoning have you come to this conclusion?
Which philosophy says that you are your body?
19

## Page 20

‘Bhe`diyaa dhasaana’ is a common rustic phrase. ‘Bhedia’ means
sheep. Bhediya dhasana refers to people who behave like sheep.
The whole flock of sheep follows the leading sheep blindly. If the
leader falls into a well, the rest follow unthinkingly. I saw this
happen at the Ara station. A flock of sheep came along. The
leader jumped over the low station wall and went on to the
railway tracks. The whole flock followed. They were all cut down
within a few minutes by an approaching train. When people
behave like that, we call it ‘bhediya dhasana’.
Please tell me, by which school of thought do you consider your
body to be your Atma? Do Muslims consider the body to be the
rooh (soul)? Do Christians, Parsis, or Sikhs believe that the body
is the soul? Do dharmaatmaa (people who adhere strictly to
Dharma), or upaasaka (those who do ritual worship), or Yogis
believe that the body is the Atma? Does anyone say that the body
and the Atma are one and the same?
If no one believes it, by which viewpoint do you believe your
body to be your ‘I’? This is what is called ‘abhinivesha’. Abhi
means ‘another kind’, and ‘nive`sha’ means to become one with
the body; to sink into it; to get immersed in it. It means to think, ‘I
am the body.’ This is a dosha, and it needs to be removed. This is
the dosha called ‘abhinivesha’.
Now, see what there is outside. There is raaga-dve`sha
(attachment-aversion). Attachment leads to partiality and
favoritism. It tips the scales in favor of the one we are attached to.
Our hatred blinds us to what is due to the other. Just check
whether you are trapped in your love for someone. Love means
raaga. Is your heart filled with a love that induces you to tell lies,
steal, compromise your integrity, or be unjust? Do your
attachments lead you to wrong actions?
Vrata is a self-imposed discipline. People fast on the eleventh
lunar date. This is called the ‘e`kaadashi vrata’. People undertake
Dharma vrata, to do nothing that is contrary to Dharma. Have you
become a moha-vrati, doing only what moha tells you? Moha is
deluded thinking. Your infatuation has colored your mind to such
20

---

## Page 21

an extent that your Guru is no longer you Guru, the Ishwara is no
longer the Ishwara, and Dharma is no longer Dharma. Your
passion is everything. You steal for the one you love, you give up
your morals and values, become violent, and tell lies. Why do you
do all this?
It is because you are in the grip of an attachment, and on the other
hand you have developed an enmity that makes you scowl at the
very mention of someone’s name. Your heart burns when you
think about him. Oh, nobody except you sees this, so look well
and check whether this is what happens. If so, your mind is sullied
with the impurity of attachments and aversions.
The third dosha is the feeling of your own greatness. ‘I am very
good looking. I have great wealth. I am very learned. I am a great
ascetic. Who can compare with me?’
I was chatting with one Raja Sahib, many years ago. In course of
the conversation, I mentioned the name of another Raja Sahib. My
companion reacted at once. ‘What Raja is he? I am a much bigger
Raja! He gets a Privy Purse of rupees twenty five thousand, while
my Privy Purse is twenty five lakhs! He is nothing compared to
me.’
This is how people find some factor that brings asmitaa (pride). I
have seen people feel that they are the owner of property and
riches. They don’t know how to bend before anyone. Proud
people are unable to bend their heads or fold their hands to
people. They can’t bend. They stand as though they have no equal
in this world. Thus, the third dosha is asmita, and it needs to be
given a sanskaras.
The fourth dosha is naasamajhee (lack of understanding), moha
(deluded thinking) and avidya (absence of right thinking). These
always cause sorrow. A child starts crying because of the dark.
This is nasamajhi. This nasamajhi, this avidya, is a great dosha,
and a great sorrow in our life. Our mother Gita removes all four
kinds of doshas and gives us four kinds of buddhi.
Abhinive`sha (identifying with our body) makes us fear death.
21

---

## Page 22

Raaga-dve`sha (attachment and aversion) bring sorrows caused
by friends and foes.
Asmitaa (pride; vanity) gives sorrow through respect and
disrespect.
Avidyaa (lack of right intellect) causes sorrow due to naasamajhi.
We get deluded and lack a balanced view of things.
Happiness increases when these doshas are removed. We can
learn from the Gita how to bring the main gunas into our lives, for
the removal of these doshas. The Gita is filled with such
clarifications.
Now, look at the four medicines for removing the four doshas.
This is not a medicine to be eaten. Mother Gita does not remove
your doshas by giving you clothes or food. She does not kill your
enemy, or keep your loved one alive. Mother Gita does not
complete your education or fulfill your pride. She destroys your
dukha (sorrow) by giving you four types of buddhi. The Gita is
wonderful! She will give you an intellect that that will enable you
to get free of your faults and sorrows. You will be filled with
happiness and good qualities. All your lackings will be removed,
and you will become whole. This mother of ours has come to give
us all these things. Now, see the order in which it is given, and
how it applies to your life.
When dharma-buddhi (the importance of Dharma) rises in the
mind, it reduces our identification with the body.
When vairaagya-buddhi (the importance of renunciation) rises in
the mind, it weakens our worldly attachments and aversion.
When bhakti-buddhi (love for Bhagwan) rises in the mind, it
removes pride and vanity.
And, when you get the bodha (understanding) of the Tattva
(essence of the Brahman) of paramaartha (the supreme state),
your nasamajhi will be removed.
Thus, mother Gita gives us four types of buddhi – Dharma
buddhi, Vairagya buddhi, Bhakti buddhi, and Gnan buddhi.
The first point to note is that the books of our Shastras – like the
Manu Smriti – distribute work according to the natural aptitude of
22

---

## Page 23

human beings. They allocate different areas of work to Brahmins,
Kshatriyas (warrior class), Vaishyas (traders; farmers) and
Shudras (labor). The Gita, however, doesn’t do this. The Gita
makes changes in your buddhi. It gives you a different outlook,
and so it makes no difference whether the person reading the Gita
is a Sanyasi (Monk), Grihastha (married householder),
Vanaprastha (semi-retired spiritual seeker) or Brahmachari
(celibate student). The Gita is equally effective in removing the
intellectual flaws in all, regardless of class or status, nationality,
the period in time, caste, or religion. The reader may be a Hindu,
Muslim, Christian or Parsi – the Gita has come to give buddhi to
all. She has come to make you buddhimaana (having a sharp and
balanced intellect). This is why the Gita changes the way you
think. The Gita says –
Buddhiyogamupaashritya macchittah satatam bhava.
(18. 57)
(Always keep your mind on Me, taking the support of a balanced
buddhi.)
‘Take buddhi! Whichever path you choose, get buddhi. Whatever
sorrow you have, take buddhi. Whatever dosha is in you, take
buddhi. Whichever guna you want, take buddhi.’ The Gita has
come to give advice, and enhance understanding; to remove
sorrow, and give happiness to all. She has come to make
everybody whole. This Bhagwat Gita is not limited to any
particular varna (class), jaati (caste), sampradaaya (religion), or
aashrama (stage of life). Nor is it limited to any country. It is a
book that is meant for all who have been born in Bhagwan’s
Creation, and live in Him.
I will now tell you how the Gita removes our doshas and dukhas.
Imagine that a man is intoxicated with his own power and wealth.
This is called ‘asmita’. Asmi means ‘I’ in Sanskrit. The grammar
is based on the fact that asmita does not exist during the state of
Samadhi. There is no sense of individual existence in deep
meditation. Therefore, the mental inclination of ‘asmi, asmi, asmi’
23

---

## Page 24

– I, I, I – is a movement of the mind. When the Upanishad says,
‘Aham brahmaasmi’, it means ‘I (Aham = the Atma) am (asmi)
the Brahman.’ This cuts away the feeling, ‘I am a jeeva’ (the
Atma attached to a body; an individual).
What is it that induces the feeling of being a separate person? ‘I
am learned, I am wealthy, I am the ruler, I am the Prime
Minister.’ People attach attributes to themselves and develop a
sense of superiority. This is asmita.
The sixteenth chapter of the Gita says –
Aadhyobhijanavaanasmi konyosti sadrisho mayaa.
(16. 15)
(I have great wealth and a large family. Who can compare with
me?)
This is also asmita. So, how can the asmita in our life be
removed? How can vanity be dispelled? I have deliberately taken
up asmita out of turn, to show how pride and vanity can be
removed. The answer is, ‘By thinking about the Ishwara.’ I agree
that you are a very important person. You have a Kingdom, you
have Gnan, and you are respected in society. I also agree that you
have tapasyaa (asceticism), a large army, and a large vote bank.
However, isn’t there anyone who is greater than you? When you
think about Him, who is the greatest – when you meditate on Him
– all your asmita will be destroyed. This means, you are giving
sanskaras to your buddhi. Your antahkaran (fourfold mind or
subtle body) is being purified and beautified. Pride has sullied
your antahkaran. The consciousness of having good qualities
sullies your mind because it makes you feel superior to others.
When you consider others to be inferior, something inferior comes
into your mind.
Imagine that a man is like a cat. What does a cat focus on? A cat
watches a mouse and a snake watches a frog, because these are
their food. Similarly, what does a vidvaana (learned man) want?
He wants to defeat another vidvana in a debate. If he is
vairaagyavaana (having renunciation), he wants to show that his
24

---

## Page 25

renunciation is greater than others’. A tapasvee (ascetic) wants to
show that he is superior to other tapasvis. When someone allows a
feeling of superiority to creep into his mind, he watches those who
are inferior in some way, to enhance the superimposed sense of
superiority. This is asmita. It is an impurity of the mind.
Asmita is when people feel superior to others. They think,
‘Everyone else is a fool. I am learned.’ ‘All the others are bhogee
(steeped in sensual indulgences); I am a Yogi.’ ‘All of the others
are agnaani (lacking Gnan); I am a Gnani.’ What is the method
for removing this dosha of asmita? How can our mind be cleansed
of this impurity?
The solution is to worship the one who is greater than we are.
Someone may say, ‘All right, I will worship a Raja who is greater
than I am.’ Or, a greater ascetic, or Gnani. That will not help to
remove your asmita. These people will consider themselves
superior to others. They will also have asmita.
Then, what is the solution? The solution is to worship the
sarvagya parame`shwara – the supreme, all-knowing Ishwara,
who is the greatest, but does not consider anyone inferior. He sees
everyone as His own essence, sees everyone in His own Gnan,
and in His own body. He is viraat (as immense as Creation itself).
He is the Hiranyagarbha (the Creator, who abides in all beings).
He experiences Himself to be the Atma of all. When your
attention goes to Him, all your pride will be washed away.
This means that bhakti for the Parameshwara does the sanskara of
the dosha of asmita in us. It destroys our pride and vanity. In the
same way, our abhinivesha is destroyed by Dharma-buddhi. Our
raaga-dvesha is destroyed by vairagya-buddhi, and our ignorance
about the Parabrahma Paramatma is destroyed by Tattvagnan –
knowledge about the essence of the Brahman.
Therefore, what the Gita does is to find out the type of buddhi we
lack, and the doshas that we have because of this lacking. Then
she destroys the doshas. You will see this throughout the Gita.
The Gita gives upade`sha (sermon, advice) about Dharma to
25

---

## Page 26

destroy adharma (that, which is contrary to Dharma). I will quote
a shloka as an example of this.
Tasmaachhaastram pramaanam te` kaaryaakaaryavyavasthitau,
Gyaatvaa shaastravidhaanoktam karma kartumihaarhasi.
(16. 24)
(The Shastra clarifies what your duty – kartavya – is, and what is
your akartavya – not your duty. Know this, and know that you are
eligible only for the actions that the Shastras say are right and
proper for you.)
When you want to talk about Dharma you have to give some
thought to your body. You have abhinivesha; you identify with
your body. From where did you get this body? How did you get
it? Is the progress of your body – the actions it does – whimsical,
or are your actions within the framework of Dharma?
I know people who say whatever comes into their head. They
have no inhibition in expressing their feelings openly and crudely.
My brother, we should be careful not to trample even an insect
when we step on the ground. We should be careful that our words
do not cause pain to any. What is Dharma? Dharma is a tapasyaa
(asceticism). Dharma comes into the life of a person who endures
discomfort for his own improvement.
Dharma comes into your life when you realize that your present
life is not everything. You had a previous life, and you will have a
future life. You got your present life because of your past life, and
your future life will depend upon the Dharma you do in this life.
This is a technique that enables you to uplift yourself from your
body.
I will tell you something about Dharma. The father of a young
village boy passed away. The villagers told the boy that he should
do a shraaddha (ritual for the departed soul) for his father. ‘What
is a shraddha?’ he asked.
‘A shraddha is a ritual done for your father.’
‘I have no father now. My father is dead.’
26

---

## Page 27

‘The father is revered. The relationship with a father is so precious
that he is respected even when his body is no more. The shraddha
is done for his life after death.’
The result was that the boy continued to respect his father. See
how this influenced his life. He was not educated; he had no
knowledge of the Vedas or the Shastras. He was little more than a
child. Yet he developed the faith that the Atma does not die with
the body. This conviction took root in his mind without his having
to read any books on theology or philosophy.
‘If the Atma lives on after the body dies, what is the Atma?’ This
thought is likely to come. And, this query can take a person right
up to Brahmagnan! Thus, the purpose of Dharma is to take us out
from the limits of our physical body. This applies to those who
know that we are not the body and also to those who think that
they are the body. Look at Dharma in the Gita. Arjuna was
anxious –
Patanti pitaro hye`shaam luptapindodakakriyaah.
(1. 42)
(Ancestors who are deprived of proper rituals like the shraddha
descend to lower realms.)
Tell me, then, doesn’t Bhagwan accept the existence of the Atma
after the death of the body? It is Bhagwan, who says in the Gita –
Hato vaa praapsyasi svarga jitvaa mokshyase` maheem,
Tasmaaduttishtha kaunte`ya yuddhaaya kritanishchayah.
(2.37)
(If you are killed in battle, you will go to Swarga, and if you
emerge the victor, you will enjoy ruling over the world.
Therefore, Arjuna, decide to fight and get up!)
‘If you take a decision to adhere to your Dharma and fight, you
will go to Swarga incase you are killed.’ You consider it a great
sukha when you get the food of your choice. You feel that the
greatest source of pleasure is the indulgence of the rasane`ndriya
(the sense organ of taste) and janane`ndriya (the organ of
27

---

## Page 28

procreation). Let go of this impression. Bring that Dharma into
your life to make sukha permanent.
What is that Dharma? Dharma is that, which is described as tapas
(asceticism) in the Gita. The Dharma of a human being is actually
asceticism. I will tell you another point – the Dharma of being a
human is separate from the Dharma of a sampradaaya (religious
sect). A human being has to be a dvijaati (twice born) in a
sampradaya. He is born as a human, and then he is reborn when
he gets the yagyopaveeta (sacred thread) sanskaara (ritual), the
khatna, baptism, etc. This is done to double the person’s identity.
(This is the Dharma of organized religion), but the Gita explains
the Dharma that applies to every human being.
Anudve`gakaram vaakyam satyam priyahitam cha yat,
Svaadhyaayaabhyasanam chaiva vaangmayam tapa ucchyate`.
(17. 15)
(A person’s speech should not cause agitation to any. It should be
pleasant, beneficial, and true. Furthermore, he should chant the
name of the Parameshwara as described in the Vedas and
Shastras. This is called the asceticism of speech.)
Speak soothingly, so that your words don’t hurt or anger anyone.
Don’t say anything inappropriate. Don’t be sarcastic and say
things that are hurtful, otherwise you will incur such a paapa (sin)
– and have to hear such harsh words – that you won’t be able to
rest in peace even after your death!
When saying something, make sure that you don’t hurt anyone’s
feelings. Say what is true and beneficial. Speak in brief and say
things that are suited to the occasion. Recite the Vedic verses of
your tradition. Study that, which describes your essence. That is
called Dharma.
De`vadvijagurupraagyapoojanam shauchamaarjavam,
Brahmacharyamahinsaa cha shaareeram tapa ucchyate`.
(17. 14)
28

## Page 29

(Worship of the Devta, Brahmins, Guru and Gnanis, keeping the
mind and body pure, being straightforward, practicing celibacy
and non-violence are the tapa of the body.)
All these are a human’s Dharma.
Manahprasaadah saumyatvam maunamaatmavinigrahah,
Bhaavasanshuddhiritye`tattapo maanusamuchyate`.
(17. 16)
(The tapa of the mind is to be tranquil and happy. Think
constantly of Me. Control the mind, and let your feelings be pure.)
Actually, Dharma means to stop ourselves. When we control our
impulsive urges we face some discomfort. A person who wants to
eat food that is pavitra (pure by Dharmik standards) must have the
capacity to endure hunger. The fact is that only a person who has
a desire to eat only pure food has the capacity to go hungry.
Thus, when Dharma comes into the life of a person, it purifies his
speech, body, and mind. It uplifts those who are trapped in
physical and sensual indulgences. Dharma is meant to give
buddhi. This geetaa-maataa (mother Gita) has come to give us the
alms of Dharma-buddhi. Dharma-buddhi will remove the mental
distortion of our abinivesha.
The sanskaras of Dharma-buddhi free us from identifying with
our body. The Gita is the mother of the human species. She is
Bhagwan’s speech. Bhagwan is our father and the Gita is our
mother. She is Saraswati (the goddess of learning) and she has
come to cleanse our intellect of all impurities. The mind won’t
become pure until the buddhi becomes pure. Nor will the body
become pure until speech becomes pure. So, it is essential that the
buddhi is pure.
If our understanding is right and proper – if right thinking is
achieved – a person will obtain the Ishwara.
The Gita says –
Buddhau sharanamanviccha kripanaah falahe`tavah.
(2. 49)

(Take shelter of the buddhi and work without any desire for the
fruit of your actions.)
The Gita tells us to be guided by pure intellect. The Gita means
buddhi-yoga (attaching the intellect to Bhagwan). It describes the
four types of buddhi-yoga – Dharma-buddhi, Vairagya-buddhi,
(Bhakti or) Aishvarya-buddhi, and Tattva-buddhi. These four are
meant to make our life limpid and cultured.

Pravachan III
Dharma-buddhi is the Best Method for Inculcating Sanskaras.
In Hindi, ‘sanskaara’ means ‘to improve’. For example, an
overgrown shrub is pruned and made shapely. Fertilizer is given
to make it flower well. The gardener makes every effort to
sweeten the fruit. Doing all these actions is doing sanskaras of the
plants. So, in common parlance, to do the sanskara of something
means to improve it. If you want to do the sanskara of the house,
you will clean the floor. If you want to do sanskara of your body
you will oil it and then wash it, to make the skin soft and clean. If
you want to do sanskara of your hair, you will get it trimmed,
have a shampoo, and comb your hair. These are all sanskaras of
your home, body and hair.
The Gita Shastra is a part of all our Shastras. The purpose of our
Shastra is to do the sanskaras of our Gnan by removing our avidya
(nescience; ignorance). The Upanishads do no gunadhana; their
function is doshapanayana. Nothing new is introduced; only
avidya is removed. Gnan is established as soon as agnaana (lack
of Gnan) is removed.
Different people have different opinions about sanskaras. The
Vedantis emphasize on the sanskaras of Gnan. Yogis emphasize
upon the removal of vikshe`pa (mental disturbances). The
upaasaka (one who believes in ritual worship) emphasize on the
destruction of vaasanaa (desire; lust), and the Dharmik people
emphasize on the faults in our character being destroyed.
If you want to decide on the order of the saadhanaa (method for
spiritual progress), then the proper order is to rise step by step.
Dravya-shuddi (purity of objects), bhoga-shuddi (purity of
31

---

## Page 32

indulgences), kriyaa-shuddhi (purity in what we do), and vaak-
shuddhi (purity of speech) is the order. The wealth that comes into
the home should be pure. Our sensual pleasures should be pure;
and our speech should also be pure. The improvements start with
the gross items.
I will now explain the science of reaching the right decision about
Dharma. To purify something means to remove the impurities in
it. Gross matter can be purified through science. You can make
medicines, atom bombs, chemical compounds, and many other
things. All these are external, and are measured with scientific
instruments, or through the senses.
Please see the vigyaana (science) of Dharma. You have been
given a laboratory – a research center – to reach a conclusion
regarding Dharma. That research center is your own body! This
physical form has legs to move it, hands for its protection, and the
storehouse of the stomach to provide nutrition. It also has a head
for gathering knowledge.
Please note – do these four divisions of the body work
independently, or do they work in unison? The feet walk for the
benefit of the whole body. It is the Dharma of the feet to not go
where the head may get some injury. It is the Dharma of the hands
to protect the eyes and ears. The hands should not allow the eyes
to be blinded or the ears to be deafened by some onslaught. The
stomach should be given food that is beneficial to the whole body.
The knowledge that comes into the brain should also be
beneficial, not detrimental.
Therefore, when we observe the body, we see that there is a need
for accumulation in the stomach, there is a need for the feet to
walk, and a need for the hands to work. There is a need to obtain
Brahmagnan – knowledge about the Brahman – some through the
ears, nose, eyes, tongue and skin. That means, we need a mind
and an intellect. We need Dharma and karma, and we need bhoga-
raaga (indulgences and attachments) too. All these have in mind
the benefit of the whole body. Thus, the laboratory for Dharma is
your body.

Let your eyes and legs work in unison. The eyes will show the
way and the legs will walk accordingly. The legs will go on
walking and the eyes will go on guiding them. This body is the
center of the divisions in society. Gross matter can be ascertained
through instruments, but Dharma is fulfilled with emotion. It is
fulfilled by a kartaa (doer) who does things. Therefore, the
science of Dharma can only be known through the analysis of the
subtle body.
You see, a human being is bound naturally within his physical
form. He believes his body to be ‘I’. He considers as ‘mine’, the
things that are useful to him. That means, he gives importance to
his individuality, and to everything that he finds convenient.
Now, see the necessity of Dharma. The viewpoint of society
changes according to the viewpoint of the body. Don’t undertake
a dharmaanushthaana (religious ritual) for personal gain; do it
with the good of the whole world in mind. This Dharma lifts us up
from being a separate fragment with separate attachments, and
connects us to the welfare of all Creation. This is why Dharma is
needed in our life.
We should not go to any place that is harmful for us, for any
other, or for society. We should do nothing that causes hurt to
any. We should go to those places, and do the things that are
beneficial for all. Just as our hands and feet work for the good of
the whole body, when our life is helpful for all, it is Dharma.
The purport of this is that Dharma is helpful in making useful that,
which is seen as natural in our body. When we limit the benefits
of Dharma to one family, religious sect, caste, locality, or country,
it becomes restricted. The fact is that the whole world is a part of
us – saptaanga (sapta = seven; anga = part). What is your
essence? Your body is composed of seven parts – earth, water,
fire, wind, space, the sun and the moon. Your hands and feet are
in your body. If all your actions, duties, and Dharma are done
with these seven parts in mind, then your deeds elevate you from
your body and help you encompass the whole world.

## Page 34

I am telling you this because the Shastra also has a viewpoint. Our
Shastra has the scientific viewpoint that it is natural for you to
consider your body to be ‘I’ since the time you were born. You do
things for the welfare of your body. When you begin to do things
for the welfare of the whole world, it is called ‘Dharma’. It also
purifies your antahkaran. This is the protection of Dharma and
destruction of adharma (that, which is contrary to Dharma).
Look at it this way – Dharma is what is useful, elevating, and
beneficial for the whole world. Adharma is what degrades,
retards, causes sorrow and disorder, and is unruly. Dharma is to be
one with all Creation. Wherever the Gita describes Dharma, you
will see dharma-nishthaa (faith in Dharma). For example –
Svadharme` nidhanam shre`yah paradharmo bhayaavahah.
(3. 35)
(To die doing our Dharma is good fortune, but following the
Dharma of others causes fear.)
* * * * *
Dharmyaaddhi yuddhaachshre`yonyatkshantyasya na vidyate`.
(2. 31)
(There is no higher duty for a Kshtriya than doing his Dharma of
fighting.)
The purpose of telling us to adhere to our own Dharma is to
indicate that you should not try to make any changes in Dharma.
You should make good use of all that the Ishwara has given you.
Naavirato dushcharitaannaashanto naasamaahitah.
(Kathopanishad 1. 2. 24)
How will you understand your Dharma from the Gita? The Gita
asks you to observe what prompts your actions in your day to day
life. Since you read the Gita, you will be able to understand this
very quickly. What takes your feet from one place to another?
What guides your hand into doing the things it does? What
34

---

## Page 35

prompts you to say the things you say? How far do you notice
these things? Are you ruled by kaama-krodha-lobha (desire-
anger-greed)? I cannot tell you, but you can use the buddhi given
by the Ishwara, to give some thought to this. You can analyze
what induces your actions. For whom do you work, and what is it
that prompts your actions?
Your yagyopavita sanskara was done when you were a child. The
Gayatri Mantra was explained to you. You were taught to pray
that the Ishwara should prompt your vritti (mental inclinations)
towards superior actions. Didn’t you learn ‘Dhiyo yo nah
prachodayaat, prakrishthe` karmani pre`saye`t – May the
Parameshwara prompt my buddhi to superior acts’? Examine
yourself to make sure that you are not prompted by kama-krodha-
lobha instead.
Who rules your life? The first thing to reflect upon is who or what
you are governed by. Are you governed by desire, anger, or
greed? Or do you obey the laws of the Ishwara and right thinking?
I can say nothing on this score. I have no right to point a finger at
you. However, your own eyes, your own sense of what is right,
and the Paramatma seated in your heart will tell you. Just give it
some thought.
When you proceed towards stealing or cheating, you are ruled by
greed. You fail to see the Ishwara at that time. When you get into
a fight you are ruled by anger. When you indulge in immoral
activities, you are ruled by lust. I am not talking about the
psychology that advocates promiscuity. What I am saying is what
actually happens. I am telling you this in public; a gentleman
known to me did not find his wife attractive. This made him
irritable and unable to sleep well at night. He consulted a doctor.
The doctor told him, ‘All your problems are due to your not
feeling attracted to your wife. You should get a mistress.’ This
was the advice given by the doctor! This is not idle chatter. The
man began to visit another woman. When his wife came to know,
she became mentally deranged. By some coincidence, she was
taken to the same psychologist. He advised her to have an affair
35

---

## Page 36

with another man. Then, they both came to me and told me about
the advice given by their psychologist. The husband succumbed to
the advice, but the wife was saved. How? It was because the
sanskaras of Dharma were imbedded in her mind. Dharma
sanskaras control the urge to do anything improper.
Dharma is your unknown friend. You don’t know this friend of
yours. You don’t recognize it as a friend. You don’t see it. If it is
established in your heart, it will give you a signal when you are
about to do anything wrong. It will make you aware that this is
something you should not do. Actually, Dharma is the
superimposed presence of the Parameshwara seated in your heart.
It stops you from stealing, cheating, misbehaving, immoral
indulgences, violence and ill-will.
You see, even the Parameshwara needs a way by which He can
prompt you. I am telling you something general. The Paramatma
will use your eyes to give you the eligibility for His darshan
(vision). You will be able to know His fragrance only through
your nose. He will give you the Gnan of sound through your ears,
and love through your heart. Similarly, He will give you the true
message of life, but it will be through the upaadhee
(superimposed means) of Dharma. The nirupaadhee (without
impositions) does not favor anyone. Nor does He inspire anyone.
He is established in His eternal essence. If Dharma is well-
established in your heart, the Ishwara accepts it as a platform and
tells you which action is good and what you shouldn’t do.
Eeshvarah sarvabhootaanaam hridde`she`rjuna tishthati,
Bhraamayansarvabhootaani yantraaroodhaani maayayaa.
Tame`va sharanam gachha sarvabhaave`na bhaarata,
Tatprasaadaatparaam shaantim sthaanam praapsyasi
shaashvatam.
(18. 61-62)
(O Arjuna! All the bodies are like machines and the Paramatma,
seated in them, makes them turn according to their individual
karmas.
36

---

## Page 37

Take refuge in that Paramatma in every way. By His Grace you
will obtain peace and the eternal supreme state.)
I don’t know stories; nor do I tell you entertaining tales. I tell you
about where Dharma and the science of Dharma are obtained. The
laboratory of Dharma is with you. The Ishwara is seated where the
sanskara of Dharma is, and He directs your life. The Ishwara’s
power is like electricity. You need to see which bulb is switched
on. If it is the bulb of desire, the world will look different. If it is
the bulb of greed, you will see the world differently. But if you
light the lamp of Dharma in your heart, the world will seem quite
different. You will notice the beautiful inspirations you get from
the Ishwara.
You will remember that yesterday I told you about how you can
do the sanskara of your life. I told you about the united actions of
the hands and feet, feet and eyes, ears and vision, mind and
intellect in our lives. They all work for the benefit of the whole
body. In the same way, there is a thing called maanavataa
(manav=human; manavata=humane-ness) in this world. There is a
thing called the vishvaatmaa (the Atma of the vishwa=world). As
we come closer to Him, Dharma will manifest in our life.
Naa brahm kshatram naa kshatram brahm vardhate` - your
efforts should be in keeping with your buddhi, and your buddhi
should develop according to your efforts. Dharma manifests the
vishvaatma-bhaava (the feeling that the Atma of the whole world
is one) in your worldly interaction.
Yesterday, I also told you that you need to remove your
abhinivesha in your body. Devtas live in Swarga and the Pitris
(ancestors) live in Pitriloka. The Ishwara descends from time to
time to protect Dharma. We should believe in all of them and
worship them. That will help you to understand that you are not a
puppet made of bones, flesh and blood. Your body is a pure
object, composed of earth, water, fire, wind, space, the sun and
the moon. It is the Vishwatma, the sarvaatmaa (sarva = all; the
Atma of all). Your enemy is no other. It is like our teeth biting our
37

---

## Page 38

own tongue, or our poking a finger into our own eye. This whole
world is our own essence.
Samam mano dhatsva na santi vidvidhah.
(Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapurana 7. 8. 10)
It is said in the Bhagwat, ‘Keep your mind perfectly balanced.
You have no enemy. You harass yourself.’
You have read in the Gita –
Uddhare`daatmanaatmaanam naatmaanamavasaadaye`t,
aatmaiva hyaatmano bandhuraatmaiva ripuraatmanah.
(6. 5)
(Cross over the sea of the world by your own efforts. Don’t allow
yourself to fall. A human being is his own friend and his own
enemy.)
Lift yourself out of the ditch into which you have fallen.
Uddhare`t means, lift yourself up from the state into which you
have sunk. So, then, what is ‘up’ and what is ‘down’? Down does
not mean lower in space. There is no ‘up’ or ‘down’ in time. You
have trapped your Self in a separate body. Understand that you
existed before this body was formed, and you entered it. That was
your rebirth. You will come out of this body and go to some other
place. So, you are not a captive in your body. You came from
some loka (land) and will go to some loka. That means, the
bondage of your body does not really exist.
Look; Dharma tells you that you were in another body before you
came into this one, and you will go into another body when you
leave this one. Therefore, this body is not your essence. You had
another form previously. It may have been that of a Devta (demi-
god) or a Danava (Demon), an animal or a bird. Now you have
this shape and form. You will get another shape and form in
future. This is the viewpoint of Dharma.
What does that mean? It means that the body you consider to be
your ‘I’ is not everlasting. It shows that it is the task of Dharma to
38

---

## Page 39

free you from your body by giving you the Gnan that you have
past lives and future lives. It tells you about Swarga loka and
Narak loka (Hell), to convince you that you do not die when the
body dies. It induces you to think about going into other species
and other human forms. A present, you consider yourself to have
such eyes, such a nose and such a mouth. You are not limited to
this appearance. The whole world is your essence. It is the task of
Dharma to liberate you from the bonds of your physical form.
This is why it is said that Dharma is to see everything from the
viewpoint of the vishva – the whole world, the Vishwatma, the
viraata (colossal form of the Creator who becomes the Creation).
And, you are a part of this immeasurable form of the
Parameshwara. You are a part of Him. You are a drop in the
ocean of Creation. The Parameshwara is the clay, and you are a
grain of clay; and a grain of clay is not separate from clay. The
Parameshwara is an ocean of which you are a drop. He is the fire
of which you are a spark. He is the wind and you are a gust of the
wind. He is space, and you are the mithyaa (illusionary)
ghataakaasha (ghata = pot; aakaasha = space. Ghatakasha is the
space in a pot that appears to be separate from all space.) You
consider yourself to be a separate part of space. You see with the
eyes of the Surya (the presiding deity of the sun) and think with
the mind of the Chandrama (the presiding deity of the moon).
Your essence is so vast that millions of universes can fit into it,
and yet you have imprisoned your Self in this paltry physical
form!
Why do you cut up your form like this? Why do you consider
yourself to be your enemy? The viewpoint of the Ishwara liberates
you from de`haadhyaasa (de`ha = body; adhyaasa = illusionary
superimposition), from abhinivesha.
I explained yesterday, that abhinivesha means becoming
immersed in your body. It means to believe the body to be
yourself. All that I have just told you about Dharma, about having
previous births, going to other lands after death, worshipping the
Devtas, and about varnaashrama (the four stages of life) – each of
39

## Page 40

this explains to you that you are not the body; you are connected
to the whole world. You are related to the anaadi (that, which has
no beginning) and the ananta (that, which has no end). You are
connected to other realms, to animals, birds, and other people; to
the Devtas and the Pitris. You are not alone and isolated. You are
connected to the whole world, so when you are overcome by
greed and steal something, you sully your own mind. Will the
things you steal remain with you? Nothing remains! People sully
their minds over land, houses, gold, silver, diamonds and pearls.
Have these ever remained with anyone, or gone with them after
death?
From which viewpoint is Dharma established? We decide what
Dharma is by experiencing our body as society. This body is like
a community, and when Dharma arises in it, the whole world
becomes one community. When we identify with all Creation, an
ethical way of living is cultivated naturally. We become free of
the greed that prompts us to steal or cheat. We are no longer
enslaved by the desires that push us into immoral acts. Nor can
anger induce us to violence and strife. This is how Dharma comes
into our life, and does the sanskara of the way we behave.
These days it has become an offence to talk about Dharma at
times. There would be many among you, who know about the
different religions in India and other countries. What has
happened is that when any Acharya (Teacher) or Prophet starts a
new school of thought – a new religious sect – at any point in
time, and for a particular group of people, people start calling it a
Dharma. I do not call this ‘Dharma’. In my view, this is a dogma,
a sect; or it is a group who wants to remove some dosha. I do not
give the name of Dharma (eternal righteousness) to a majhab
(religious sect). I consider Dharma to be that, which has the
system of keeping the whole world in control.
Please listen attentively to this – what we refer to as the Vedas
have rules that were created along with Creation itself. In other
words, the constitution of Creation is called the Vedas. The
40

---

## Page 41

Ishwara’s constitution for the proper running of society is called
Dharma.
In these times, people do not easily understand the decree of
Dharma, but I will simplify it further. Look at it this way –
Dharma is that, which subdues your urge of lust, greed, and anger;
and makes you experience urges that bring benefits to the whole
world. These urges are prompted by the Ishwara.
Understand it like this – Dharma is not any of the things that take
you away from the shaashvata (eternal). The nitya (everlasting),
the pavitra (pure), and the poorna (whole). Dharma leads you
from the vinashvara (that, which is subject to destruction) to the
avinaashee (that, which is never destroyed). Dharma is that,
which accepts and upholds the management of the whole.
See another viewpoint. Where does Dharma abide? Dharma
merges the dehadhyasa into the Vishwatma. The consciousness in
the de`haatmaa (the Atma attached to a body) and the Vishwatma
is the same. It connects you to the whole, because the body is not
separate from the world.
Take a third sanskara into your mind. Dharma is that sanskara,
which removes the sorrows of your antahkaran. Now, the dukha
of being immoral is removed by Dharma, and the dukha of lust is
removed by upaasanaa (worship). Desire cases a great deal of
suffering. Desires lie deep in the chitta (fluctuating mental
movements). The raaga-dve`sha (attachments-aversions) in your
chitta exist at a deeper level than violence or promiscuity.
Violence and promiscuity are the external manifestations of the
real disease – the desires that lie deep within. So, when you begin
to worship the Ishwara for the removal of these desires, you
develop love for the Ishwara, you get bhakti. The vaasanaa (avid
desire) is pushed out of your heart. Then you are no longer bound
by your attachments. You become free of raga-dvesha. Actually,
what I ought to have said is that you obtain vairaagya
(detachment). Vairagya is very important for the Buddhists, Jains,
Shaivites and Vedanti Sanyasis.
41

---

## Page 42

Vairagya is excellent, but keep in mind that tyaaga (renunciation)
is predominant in it. That is why this word is used with great care
in the Gita. You may, or may not have noticed this. ‘Vairaagyam
samupaashritah (18. 52) – take the support of vairagya.’
What a fantastic thing Bhagwan Shri Krishna has done! He felt, ‘I
am preparing Arjuna to fight a war, for the purpose of removing
adharma, and establishing Dharma in the world. If I use the word
‘vairagya’ freely, Arjuna will refuse to fight. He has already said,
“Shre`ya bhoktum bhakshyamapeeha loke` (2. 5) – it is better that
I beg for my food!” He is ready to be a vairaagee (mendicant), so
I must be careful.’ So, Bhagwan used the word ‘anaasakti’ – non-
attachment – instead. Remain unattached; let go of attachments. In
fact, anasakti and vairagya mean the same thing. Vairagya is used
for a Sanyasi and anasakti is used for a Grihastha.
What happens when detachment is awoken? The person feels,
‘Let me become a Vaishnav. Let me leave home and become a
Sanyasi. Or, let me be a Vanaprasthi. Or, let me sit in a cave and
practice Yoga.’ Detachment contains renunciation. Bhagwan
thought, ‘Tyaga is connected to vairagya. A man who becomes
detached gives up everything. Vairagya is worthless unless a
person is prepared to give up worldly considerations. I should
choose a word that is not linked to renunciation, yet has the
benefits of detachment.’ This is why He used ‘anasakti.’
Hence, the second sanskara of the mind is the removing of raga-
dvesha. Kama is removed along with raga, and immoral behavior
is removed with the removal of kama. Krodha is removed along
with dvesha, and hinsa is removed when krodha is removed. So
the word ‘anasakti’ is used in the Gita for the removal of raga-
dvesha.
Now, think from the viewpoint of sadhana, about the sanskara that
anasakti gives to our antahkaran. When upasana connects our
mind to the Parameshwara, our attachment to worldly objects is
removed automatically. It is wrong, if someone claims to have
attachment for both the Ishwara and wealth. Asakti means to get
stuck, as two objects are stuck with glue. People say, ‘I cannot let
42

---

## Page 43

go of this.’ They have asakti for a woman or a man, wealth or
property. Upasana destroys this asakti.
Don’t ever lose heart. Never get depressed. Bhagwan has given us
two capacities that stay with us. He reminds us of these every day.
What are the two capacities? One is the capacity to give up
everything. We have this capacity. You will ask, ‘How?’ We let
go of everything when we go to sleep and experience complete
repose. Can you stay without sleep? No! That means, it is
necessary for you to enjoy absolute solitude. Bhagwan shows you
that you possess non-attachment and renunciation, but you never
pay attention to this message.
And, what is the other capacity? It is the capacity to create new
worlds. When you have a dream, you are creating a new world.
The Ishwara is saying, ‘Look; I have given you all the capacities
of the Ishwara. I create new worlds, so do you. I destroy My
creations, and stay in complete solitude, and so do you.’ This is
established every time you sleep.
In the deep sleep state there is no awareness of anything. This is a
great gift that the Ishwara gives, but worldly people never notice
it. They ask, ‘How can we live without our loved ones?’ You will
live the way you live during your six hours of sleep. People ask,
‘How can we give up this world and create a new one?’ It is just
like the dreams you dream in your sleep. You should definitely
not get depressed or disheartened about this.
If you can’t stay in Bombay, you can stay at Madras, or go and
live in the Himalayas. You may not live with this group of people,
you can live with some other group. You not only have the
capacity to create a new world, you also have the capacity to give
up everything. Upasana has these two possibilities – you can leave
everything and sit, united with the Ishwara, and create Vaikuntha
or Goloka. You can delight in the world of dreams. Or, you can
renounce everything and go into a Samadhi to enjoy a state
similar to deep sleep.
Goloka-Vaikuntha etc depend predominantly on upasana of the
Ishwara, whereas Samadhi depends on the upasana of the Atma. I
43

---

## Page 44

am explaining the vigyaana (science) of the entire Shastras. If you
want to establish your mind in your Self, the perception of duality
must disappear. But if you want your mind to be immersed in
another object – the Ishwara – the perception of duality cannot be
removed. You will get the experience of Vaikuntha, Goloka, etc.
It will seem like a dream; and Samadhi will seem like a deep
sleep.
The base of all the sanskaras is in this limited physical form we
have. This body contains the sanskara of Dharma form tip to toe.
It also contains the sanskara of upasana and Yoga. All vigyan
comes from this body. Vigyan was not born in Tibet; nor was it
created two thousand years ago. It is not that the Yogis who lived
four or fine thousand years ago knew this science but we don’t. It
is not that Acharyas who lived ten thousand years ago had the
knowledge of the science of upasana and we lack it. It is not that
these sciences are written in books but absent in our lives. After
all, they were written in books! Mahatmas have had the visual
experiences of Vedic mantras. This drashtaa (the one who sees;
the Atma), the Paramatma seated in the heart, is the drashta of the
Vedas, of the Ishwara, of Dharma, and of Goloka-Vaikuntha.
Everything else apart, He is the drashta of the drashta! All science
is created before Him and destroyed before Him.
So, this Gita gives us the indication of dharma-vigyaana (the
science of Dharma), upasana, Yoga, and Gnan. Upasana unites us
with the te`jas-aatmaa (the effulgent Self). Yoga unites us with
the praagya-eeshvara (the Ishwara who is correct knowledge).
Upasana establishes us in the Ishwara; it enables all our desires to
be immersed in the Parameshwara who is our most beloved. It is
the state of bhakti. And, Tattvagnan (Gnan about the non-dual
essence of the Brahman) destroys our avidya. It does the sanskara
of our avidya.

Pravachan IV
Let us go there, where Bhagwan is seated on Arjun’s ratha
(chariot) as the saarathi (the driver of the chariot). Arjuna sees the
armies to his left and right. Four things come to his mind as he
looks at them. The first thing he does is to turn away from his
Dharma as a warrior; he refuses to fight. The reason he gives is,
‘svajana (my own people)’.
‘Drishtve`mam svajanam krishna yuyutsum samupasthitam.’
(1. 28)
(Arjuna said, ‘O Krishna, the sight of these warriors ready to fight
has stolen the strength of my limbs.)
Na cha shaknomyavasthaatum bhramateeva cha me` manah.
(1. 30)
(My mind is confused, and I am unable to stand.)
Na cha shre`yonupashyaami hatvaa svajanamaahave`.
(1. 31)
(I cannot see any good coming of my killing my own people. This
war will not bring us credit or good fortune.)
Thus, a particular viewpoint regarding Dharma has been given in
the Gita. This Gita places a question – Dharma or Karmayoga?
(Karmayoga is to connect ourselves to Bhagwan through our
actions.)
There is a Dharma that is done in the Yagyashala (the place where
a ritual of fire worship is done) to obtain Swarga. This Dharma is
done only in a portion of your life. You may surely do agni hotra
(offer oblations in the fire), godaana (giving a cow to a Brahmin
in charity), run a center to provide drinking water, create
45

---

## Page 46

educational institutions, or donate food – all these are part of
Dharma. However, along with these good deeds, you may also be
doing paapa (sinful acts). Thus, the Dharma that is established in
only a part of your life is an incomplete Dharma. Actually,
Dharma should be such that it pervades our entire life. So, pay
attention to the Dharma of the Gita; it is quite different from the
Dharma of the Yagyashala.
The Dharma described in the Gita is such that it stays with you
day and night, while you sleep and when you are awake, when
you sit or walk. That is why the Gita has a sarcastic comment
about the Dharma that is done to obtain Swarga after death. The
Gita does not advocate Dharma done for obtaining future worldly
benefits, whether they are for this life, or for after death. It is
critical of this. You would have noticed this. If not, please do so
now.
Yaamiaam pushpitaam vaacham pravadantyavipashchitah,
ve`davaadarataah paartha naanyadasteeti vaadinah.
Kaamaatmaanah svargaparaa janmakarmafalapradaam,
kriyaavishe`shabahumaan bhogaishvaryagatim prati.
(2. 42-43)
(O Arjuna, these people are preoccupied with self-indulgences.
They love the Vedic verses that extol the fruits of karmas, and
think that Swarga is the highest goal. Such talk lacks substance. It
can be compared to the flowers that bloom for a day or two, but
bear no fruit. These people work for transient, worthless goals.)
The karmas done in a Yagyashala are specific karmas, whereas
the Gita gives importance to the attitude with which we work.
Every ordinary action becomes Karmayoga. In the Yagyashala, it
is the action that is important; in the Gita it is the attitude that
turns all your actions into Karmayoga. Unless you understand this
fundamental difference, you will not be able to see the
revolutionary dharma-kshe`tra (field of Dharma) of the Gita.
So, ‘Kaamaatmaanah svargaparaah’ – kama is present when you
do a Yagya; and the fruit you desire is Swarga.
46

## Page 47

Janmamrityufalapradaam – to be born again and again, to die
again and again, and obtain sensual experiences again and again.
This is the viewpoint of the ritualistic Dharma. And, the Gita’s
viewpoint about Dharma is that you do everything with a balanced
viewpoint while remaining free of attachment.
Sukhadukhe` same` kritvaa laabhaalaabhau jayaajayau,
tato yuddhaaya yujyasva naivam paapamavaapsyasi.
(2. 38)
(Be prepared to fight with an attitude of equal acceptance whether
you get victory or defeat. Consider gain and loss, happiness and
sorrow to be equal. If you fight with such an attitude you will not
incur sin.)
Arjuna believes that he will incur sin by fighting. Bhagwan says,
‘Yes, you will certainly incur sin if you fight for personal gain, or
to obtain Swarga.’ Meaning, any benefit in this life of after death.
‘However, sukha-dukhe` same` kritvaa – consider sukha-dukha to
be the same, and carry out your yuddha-dharma (the Dharma of
fighting). Then you will not incur sin.’ This is the angle given to
us by the Gita. Every Shastra gives us some or other angle. To
consider happiness and sorrow as equal is a sanskara that
beautifies our actions.
The meaning of Karmayoga is –
Karmajam buddhiyuktaa hi falam tyaktvaa maneeshinah,
janmabandhavinirmuktaah padam gachhantyanaamayam.
(2. 51)
(The Gnanis use the viewpoint of equality to give up the fruits of
their actions. They are liberated from the bonds of rebirth, and all
mental distortions. They attain the supreme state.)
What is the special viewpoint, where all actions become Dharma?
It is the viewpoint of samataa (being equally detached to the
result), the viewpoint of anaasakti (being unattached), the
47

## Page 48

viewpoint of nishkaamataa (being disinterested). This Gita has
brought a sanskara for us, and that is – go on doing your ordained
work. Do your job. Carry on with your business, fight a battle,
invent something new, or study the Shastras. However do it with a
balanced outlook, without being attached to the outcome.
Let us now examine how the sanskara of the moha and mamata
(illusion and affection) in the mind is done. The Gita does not tell
you to abandon the objects of your attachment and illusions. Nor
does Sanyas Dharma tell you to give up the people or objects you
like. The Gita tells you to let them be; just withdraw your
attachment to them. I am telling you this from several viewpoints.
It is another thing to do the paatha (ritual recitation) of the Gita,
and another thing to be entertained by some amusing story I may
narrate. Please pay close attention to the points given by the Gita
for removing your moha-mamata. Learn to cultivate this
viewpoint. The Gita will catch your hand and guide your work.
She will give you the Gnan that will enable you to remain
liberated even while working.
You get attached or deluded by the objects of Prakriti (the
Ishwara’s power of creation and delusion). The objects may be in
any form. People get attached to a horse, ox, elephant, or motor
car. They get attached to diamonds, pearls, gold and silver; or a
man, woman, brother or friend. When the attachment becomes
very strong, the person becomes deluded. The visible object
becomes the object of attachment and delusion, and also of
aversion. Had the gold, silver or diamonds felt attachment, there
would be no need to do sanskaras. However, the attachment for
jewels, people, animals or other possessions is in your mind. That
is why it is necessary to do the sanskara of your mind. It is the
dirty area that needs to be cleaned; people don’t start cleaning a
clean corner, ignoring the dirty corner. You must now look
closely at the viewpoint the Gita gives you about this; how she
does the sanskara of your mind.
Think about these three points first, and then I will tell you the
fourth point, provided I remember! One viewpoint of the Gita is
48

---

## Page 49

that all the tangible objects you see – women-men, wealth,
animals, houses, etc – both animate and inanimate – belong to
Prakriti. The Atma is not attached to them. Think about this from
three angles. These objects change so rapidly from the viewpoint
of science that the object of your attachment never remains the
same. Prakriti changes constantly.
Anityamasukham lokamimam praapya bhajasva maam.
(9.33)
(Do My bhajan constantly because you have been given a human
form, while living in the constantly changing world, because there
is no enduring happiness in it.)
This loka – the world you see – has three things. One is jadataa
(gross matter), that includes the bodies of men, women, animals,
brothers and friends. Everything that is created by Prakriti is
inanimate. You are consciousness. This is one point.
The second point is that Prakriti keeps changing. It is asat (that,
which is not Sat. Sat is existence that can never be negated). It is
dukha.
I will tell you about an incident in my life. There was a man who
showered me with affection. Then, we drifted apart due to
circumstances. I retained the impression that he was very fond of
me, but in two months’ time, his affection was transferred to
someone else. His attitude towards me was changed completely. I
continued to retain my impression of his genuine regard. This is
how people change. If someone tells me, ‘I will do this work as
long as I am with you,’ it shows that he expects to part from me
one day. The sansaara (interactive world) is ashaashvat (not
eternal); it is a dukhaalaya (an abode of sorrow).
Anityam asukham lokam (this transient world that lacks
happiness). So, who is your moha-mamata for? If you reflect upon
the essence of the objects you see, your moha-mamata will
reduce. This is one angle.
Now see another angle. It is called the removing of moha-mamata
for the purpose of developing vairagya. The results, suffering, and
49

---

## Page 50

sanskaras seen in this world show that the world keeps changing
continuously. All this has an adverse impression upon our chitta
(fluctuating thoughts). Our heart starts burning when we see
someone, and different tendencies arise in the mind. Thus, when
you get a glimpse of the faults of this world, you give up your
moha-mamata. This is how vairagya is developed.
Mare`nge` mara jaaye`nge` koyee na le`gaa naam,
ujada jaaye` basaaye`nge` chhoda basanta gaama.
Haada jarai jaise` laakadee ke`sha jarai jaise`ghaas,
saba jaga jalataa de`khakara bhayaa kabeera udaasa.
(We will all die; nobody will even remember our name. When a
garden is destroyed, a new one is created. The bones burn like
wood; hair burns like grass. Kabeera sees the whole world
burning and feels sad.)
Your faith, that your son will always be loyal to you, is
commendable; but when he gets married, won’t he be loyal to his
wife? When he becomes a father, won’t he be loyal to his son?
Has he taken an oath to be loyal only to you and to no one else?
The Gita’s method is to reduce your worldly attachments and
illusions by pointing out the flaws in this world.
Anityamasukham lokam (9. 33), dukhaalayam ashaashvatam (8.
15). This world is gross matter, it is transient, and it is full of
sorrow.
Now I will tell you another method. You are not the cause of this
tangible world. Leave the subject of Prakriti, in which everything
changes continuously. See this world as the Ishwara’s creation.
He is not only the creator, He Himself becomes the world. He
plays with Himself, as Creator and Creation, both; and then He
contracts it so that disappears in Him.
Aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate`,
iti matvaa bhajante` maam budhaa bhaavasamanvitaah.
(10. 8)
50

## Page 51

(I, Vasudev, abide in everything. I am the cause of Creation. All
movements are caused by Me. An intelligent person understands
this, has faith and bhakti, and does My bhajan all the time.)
A mother gives a toy to her child to play with. When she wants to
feed him, she takes away the toy and suckles him. Similarly, when
the Parameshwara wants to give you a toy, He creates this world,
and when He wants to take it away, it disappears into Him.
Understand this angle! This world does not belong to you; it
belongs to the Ishwara. If you are deluded into believing that the
Ishwara’s property is yours, you will have to weep.
Have you heard this Vedic verse – priyam tvaam rotsyati –
whatever you love in this world will make you weep. It will
become bondage for you.
There is a shloka of Bhartruhari that I used to shout out loud when
I was a child. I would sit at Varanasi’s Manikarnika Ghat, where
the dead are cremated, and say –
Avashyam yaataarashchirataramushitvaapi vishayaa viyoge` ko
bhe`dastyajati na jano yat svayamamoon,
vrajantah svaatantryaadatulaparitaapaaya manasah svayam
tyaktaa hye`te` shamasukhamanantam vidadhati.
It is said that everything in the world will leave one day, without
exception. If things go on their own, they will make you cry, but if
you let go of them, you will obtain great happiness and peace. The
purifying effect of tyaaga (renouncing) will come into your heart.
So, for letting go of moha-mamata, you should remember that this
world belongs to the Ishwara, and is ruled by Him. You have no
hand in it. Offer up everything to Him; your attachment and
delusion (of being the owner) will reduce. You will see this
repeatedly in the Gita.
Eeshvarah sarvabhootaanaam hridde`she`rjuna tishthati,
bhraamayansarvabhootaani yantraaroodhaan maayayya.
Tame`va sharam gaccha sarvabhaave`na bhaarata,

tatprasaadaatparaam shaantimn sthaanam praapsyasi
shaashvatam.
(18. 61-62)
(O Arjuna! This body is an instrument that the Paramatma rides
upon, driving it according to the people’s karmas. He does so with
the help of His power of delusion. Shelter in that Paramatma in
every way. By His Grace, you will attain supreme peace, and the
realm of eternity.)
Tat prasaadaat refers to the Parameshwara hidden in the heart. It
does not mean the sanctified food that is distributed after a ritual
of worship. The Parameshwara hides in your heart and deceives
you. You deceive Him in a thousand ways, trying to hide things
from Him. He deceives you only in one thing – that He stays
hidden in your heart.
Tat prasaadaat means, when the curtain of Maya is removed, and
the Paramatma is seen, the person is filled with happiness and
peace.
Pay attention to this principle of the Gita –
Macchittaa madgatpraanaa bodhayantah parasparam,
kathayantashcha maam nityam tushyanti cha ramanti cha.
Te`shaam satatayuktaanaam bhajataam preetipoorvakam,
dadaami buddhiyogam tam ye`na maamupayaanti te`.
(10. 9-10)
(The bhaktas who think about Me constantly, offer up all their
actions to Me, and talk about Me with each other, find it very
satisfying. They delight in Me all the time. They meditate
continuously and lovingly on Me. I give them Yoga, in the form
of Tattvagnan, through which they attain Me.)
‘Nothing in this world is mine.’ Everything should be offered up
to the Ishwara with this attitude. ‘The wealth is not mine; it
belongs to Bhagwan. This elephant, horse, care and house all
belong to the Ishwara, not to me. I am not the master of this body;
52

---

## Page 53

the Ishwara is the Master.’ This is how you should view
everything. One angle for reducing moha-mamata is that
everything created by Nature is destroyed in the end. Another
angle is that everything belongs to the Ishwara.
Now see the third angle – the essence of the Atma is unattached.
Asango na hi sajjate`. The unattached consciousness remains
asanga from all the things that came into your life and went away.
However, this is not vairagya! Vairagya comes by thinking about
the faults of transient objects. Bhakti comes by offering
everything you are fond of to the Ishwara. And you become
asanga by thinking about your essence, which is always
unattached. All three are saadhan (methods for spiritual progress).
What do they achieve?
They are methods for removing moha-mamata.
I will now introduce another point – there is a difference between
asangataa (being asanga) and the Samadhi of Yoga. Samadhi is a
Yogic state – it is not complete Yoga (yoking yourself to the
Ishwara). People say that Samadhi is Yoga because they do not
have a proper knowledge about Yoga Darshan. I am speaking
from the viewpoint of the philosophy of Yoga. If you remember
this sootra (aphorism), repeat it once –
Yama-niyama-aasana-praanaayaama-pratyaahaara-dhaaranaa-
dhyana-samaadhayoshtaavangaani.
(Yoga Darshan 2. 29)
(Yama=control of the mind; niyama=external disciplines;
asana=yogic postures; pranayama=breath control exercises;
pratyahara=bringing the mind repeatedly to the object of
meditation; dharana=keeping the mind focused;
dhyaana=meditation; Samadhi=deep meditation. These are the
eight parts of Yoga.)
Yoga has eight parts. A part is not the whole. When the objects
are given up during Samadhi, it is because the person is in a state
of deep mediation, so he is not aware of the external world. When
he is in a Samadhi, he sees neither an elephant, nor a man, nor any
other object. Naturally, there is no moha-mamata either.
53

---

## Page 54

Asangata, however, is such that the person is conscious of all the
things, but not attached to any of them. Bhagwan first shows us
that Samadhi is different from asangata. Now He is pointing out to
us that asangata is different from nivritti (withdrawing from
worldly activities). What is nivritti? Nivritti is when a man takes
Sanyas and renounces all the Vedic karmas, gives up even his
shikhaa (the sacred tuft of hair) and sootra (sacred thread). He
lives alone and meditates on the Atma. That is called ‘nivritti’.
The principal Dharma of a Sanyasi is nivritti, while Samadhi is a
special mental condition of a Yogi. If you become nivrit
(withdrawn from worldly activities) and become asanga, that is
not the asangata of the Gita. If you enter a Samadhi and become
asanga, that is not the asangata of the Gita either. The asangata of
the Gita is that you stay with people and work normally, but are
mentally unattached.
Ye` tu sarvaani karmaani mayi sanyasya matparah,
ananye`naiva yoge`na maam dhyaayanta upaasate`.
Te`shaamaham samuddhartaa mrityusansaarasaagaraat,
bhavaami nachiraatpaartha mayyaave`shitache`tasaam.
Maiye`va mana aadhatsva mayi buddhim nive`shaya,
nivashishyasi maiye`va ata oordhvam na sanshayah.
(12. 6-8)
(The bhaktas who are always inclined towards Me, offering up all
their actions to Me, do My bhajan continuously. This is their
Bhaktiyoga – to be yoked continuously with Me, the Paramatma
with attributes.
O Arjuna, the bhaktas who love Me are quickly lifted up by Me,
out of the sea of the world. Apply your mind and intellect to Me;
then you will dwell in Me. There is no doubt about this.)
The essence of asangata is to meditate upon the essence of
Prakriti, so that moha-mamata is reduced. It is to offer up
everything, both moving and unmoving objects, all possessions,
and people, to Bhagwan. It is to use vive`ka (discrimination) to
54

---

## Page 55

separate our essence from everything else. The boatmen oil their
bodies before going into the water. The oil prevents water from
entering the pores of their skin. The water lily blooms in the water
but is untouched by it. In the same way, the Atma is untouched by
the interactive world, even while you interact in it. So, see the
essence of the asanga Atma. The drashtaa (uninvolved observer;
the Atma) is the drashta – the one who sees. The saakshee
(witness) is the sakshi. The che`tan (consciousness) is the chetan.
They can never be merged into the jada (gross matter). The
anaatmaa (that, which is not the Atma) can never mingle with the
Atma. The Atma is never satisfied with gross matter. It never gets
the feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’; it is unattached, no matter how many
people come and go. ‘Saakshee aatmaa asango naiva sajjate`.’
The Gita does not tell us to be asanga by going into a Samadhi; it
tells us to be asanga while living in this interactive world. Thus,
knowing the essence of Prakriti, offering up everything to the
Ishwara, and being aware of the fact that our essence is asanga,
are the three viewpoints given to us by the Gita. I am deliberately
repeating them so that they are well understood and retained in
your mind.
There is a fourth point that will amaze you! The thing is that this
world is pratyaksha (known through the senses). We can examine
its essence by using instruments that enhance the power of our
senses. The knowledge obtained helps us to analyze and separate
gross matter.
If you wish to understand the external world through the use of
scientific instruments, you can successfully separate the atoms,
particles, grains, etc. You see this table as a solid object.
However, if it is seen through a machine you will see nothing that
can be called a table. If an extremely fast ray is shot at the table, it
will go through the table without leaving a hole. The table can be
revolved at such a high speed that you won’t know that it is a
table. All these inventions have been made, using gross matter.
The science-assisted Gnan of your senses has the capacity to
penetrate the secrets of Prakriti. In the same way, the shraddhaa
55

---

## Page 56

(faith)-assisted vigyaana (science) has the capacity to establish the
unknown, unseen essence of the Ishwara in our heart. The Ishwara
cannot be known through the senses. He is not the mind. Nor is
He an instrument. You need shraddha to know Him. Thought that
is filled with shraddha dwells upon the Ishwara, and induces the
person to offer up everything to Him. Similarly, discrimination
about the Atma when the mind is turned inwards makes you
asanga. Vive`k (discrimination) accompanied by shraddha is
bhakti; vivek turned inwards is asangata. Vivek that has neither
shraddha nor antarmukhataa (the tendency to turn inwards), and
is focused on gross matter, is called vigyana (science).
I will tell you another thing in this context. A gentleman came to
meet me. He was studying at Pilani. He was writing a thesis,
comparing the qualities needed in research. He stated that the
qualities needed for obtaining Gnan about paramaartha (the
supreme) are the same as those needed to obtain knowledge about
gross matter. Shama (mental and physical restraint), dama (self-
control), uparati (lack of interest in other subjects), titikshaa
(endurance), shraddha ((faith) and samaadhaana (correct
conclusion) are required for both. I am telling you this for your
information.
Unless and until your mind is at peace, your senses are controlled,
you have no interest in other matters, are willing to endure
discomfort, have faith in what you are doing, and concentrate on
your work, you cannot be successful even in scientific research.
The only difference is that in the research of gross matter, these
six qualities – called the shat-sampatti – are needed
simultaneously and continuously. That being the case regarding
gross matter, how can you hope to obtain Tattvagnan if your mind
is not at peace due to lack of shat-sampatti?
Thus, these are the three divisions. We can use our senses
reinforced by powerful instruments, to examine things. And, we
can use shraddha and vivek to know that this world is a form of
the Ishwara. The Ishwara abides in all things – He is the
antaryaamee. He is the abhinna nimittopaadaana kaarana (the
56

---

## Page 57

cause that is not different from the matter) of the world. He is the
sarve`shvara – the Ishwara of all. He is sarvagya – all-knowing.
He is the supreme consciousness. We can do His bhakti and lose
ourselves in Him. We can turn inwards and use vivek to become
asanga.
Pratyaksha is that, which can be known through the senses.
Paroksha is the unseen Ishwara. And, aparoksha (that of which we
are aware, but not through the senses) is our Atma. This is how
vivek is used to develop asangata. Now, remains the fourth vivek.
The fact is that the vivek that contains shraddha is bhakti. Bhakti
means vivek, and vivek about the aparoksha vastu (the object that
is an inner awareness) is called vivek. Thinking analytically is
called vivek.
The Gita now places before you something quite wonderful;
something that destroys moha-mamataa (delusion-attachment)
and shoka (sorrow) completely. This is the quintessence of the
Upanishads. We can experience this as our Atma by using vivek
that is turned inwards. We know it as the Ishwara first, using the
vivek that contains shraddha and bhakti. We become immersed in
the Ishwara. The Ishwara and the Atma are one and the same. One
(the Ishwara) is on the other side of the pratyaksha (experienced
by our senses) and the other (the Atma) is on this side of the
pratyaksha. The superimposition of the pratyaksha is in-between,
separating them. If we see it from the angle of what can be seen, it
is the Ishwara’s creation. However, the Ishwara who stays beyond
His creation and creates the world – and the Atma that stays apart
from the world and watches – are essentially one and the same.
The Gita has brought us –
Yo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati,
tasyaaham na pranashyaami sa cha me` na pranashyati.
Sarvabhootamsthitam yo maam bhajatye`katvamaasthitah,
sarvathaa vartamaanopi sa yogee mayi vartate`.
Aatmaupamye`na sarvatra samam pashyati yorjuna,
sukham vaa yadi vaa dukham sa yogee paramo matah.
(6. 30-32)
57

## Page 58

(When a person sees Me, Vasudev, as the all-pervading Atma of
all beings, neither am I ever out of his view, nor is he ever out of
Mine.
A person who has equal benevolence for all, because be knows
that I am the Sacchidananda [pure existence, consciousness and
bliss] in them, and do My bhajan, abide in Me.
O Arjuna! In my opinion, a person who sees all beings as himself,
and sees their sukha-dukha as his own, is the supreme Yogi.)
Notice the meaning of ‘pratyaksha’ here. What is referred to as
pratyaksha is ‘sarva bhoota’ – all the living beings in the world.
The sarva bhoota as visible; they are experienced by our senses.
And, who is seated in them all? It is ‘maam’ – ‘parame`shvara yo
maam pashyati sarvatra – he, who sees Me, the Paramatma,
everywhere. Tasyaaham na pranashyaamisa cha me` na
pranashyati.’ If you see the Ishwara in all beings, and see all
beings as existing in Him, the Ishwara will always be before you.
This is the characteristic of the paroksha Ishwara. He is in all, and
all are in Him.
Now, take a look at the characteristic of the Ishwara. The Atma is
sarvabhoota.
Sarvabhootasthamaatmaanam sarvabhootaani chaatmani.
(6. 29)
(The Atma of a yogi, who sees the all-pervading, infinite
consciousness as established in all beings, is always yoked to the
Ishwara.)
All beings abide in the Atma, and the Atma abides in all beings.
The characteristic of the Ishwara is also the characteristic of the
Atma. That means, from the viewpoint of the srishti (the world),
the kartaa (doer) of the whole world – who is the omniscient
Ishwara of all, and who we believe to be beyond the world – and
the drashtaa (one who sees), who we believe to be our Atma and
who sees the world – are both one; not two. We are in the world,
58

---

## Page 59

and the world is in us. The world is in the Ishwara, and the
Ishwara is in the world.
Which means, the world is the pratyaksha sarvabhoota – all these
beings we know through our senses, while the paroksha (that,
which is not known through our senses) Ishwara and the
aparoksha (of which we have a subtle consciousness) Atma are
not two – they are one. This is the conclusion that is established
by ‘Yo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati (6. 30)
– he, who sees Me as the Atma in all beings and sees all in Me.’
The Ishwara – maam – is also the Atma in
sarvabhootasthamaatmaanam. That they are one and the same is
made clear by bhajatyakatvamaasthitah. E`katva means, it is the
same Atma in maam; and that, which is ‘maam’ is also the Atma.
They are one and the same. This is the meaning of Tattvamasi, the
Mahavakya (ultimate statement) of the Vedas. (Tat means ‘that’;
tvam means ‘you’; asi means ‘are. You, the Atma, are That, the
Brahman.) Yo maam pashyati sarvatra is the tat padaartha (‘that’
object), sarvabhootasthamaatmaanam sarvabhootaani chaatmani
is the tvam padaartha (‘you’ object), and sarvabhootasthitam yo
maam bhajatye1 katvamaasthitah is the asi padaartha (‘are’
factor).
The Gita has presented a fourth point, that the interactive world is
not separate from the Ishwara. Since the Atma and the Ishwara are
one and the same, there is no question about the world being
separate from the Atma.
Mayaa tatamidam sarvam jagadavyatktamoortinaa,
matsthaani sarva bhootaani na chaaham te`shvavasthitah.
Na cha matsthaani bhootaani pashya me` yogamaishvaram.
(9. 4 -5)
(This world is filled with My formless essence, just as ice is filled
with water. All beings exist in Me, and are supported by My
resolve. However, the fact remains that I am not in them. None of
the beings actually exist in Me. This is My quality as the Ishwara.)
59

## Page 60

Bhagwan first said, ‘Yo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi
pashyati.’ What is ‘sarvatra mayi pashyati’? It is ‘Matsthaani
sarva bhootaani – all the bhoota abide in Me.’ Then Bhagwan
said, ‘Na cha matsthaani bhootaani – the bhootas are not in Me.’
How can this be possible? It can be possible only if the Atma and
the Ishwara are one.
See the fun! By the Grace of the Ishwara, the fourth viewpoint is
that nothing else exists! Then, for whom can you have moha-
mamata? Four viewpoints have been given. The objects of Prakriti
are all transient, so moha-mamata is false. The Ishwara’s creation
is the Ishwara, it is filled with the Ishwara, so moha-mamata are
false. The Atma, who is the drashta, is the asanga chaitanya
(unattached consciousness), so moha-mamata are false. And,
nothing exists except the Parabrahma Paramatma, who is pure
consciousness, so moha-mamata are false.
Please note Arjuna’s objections – ‘Drishtve`vam svajanam
krishna yuyutsum samupasthitam’. Moha-mamata arose when he
saw his own people.
‘Seedanti mama gaatraani.’ Seedanti means, ‘my body is being
torn apart.’ ‘Mukham cha parishushyati – my mouth is dry. I am
thirsty. Vipathushcha shareere` me` romaharshashcha jaayate` - I
am trembling, and my hair is standing on end.’ Aren’t they all
symptoms of fever? ‘Gaandeevam sransate` hastaattvakchaiva
paridahyate` - the Gandiva is slipping form my hand, and my
body is burning. Na cha shaknomyavasthaatum – there is no
steadiness in me. Bhrateeva cha me` manah – my mind is in a
whirl.’ And, ‘Na cha shre`yonupashyaami hatvaa
svajanamaahave` - I see no good in fighting.’
Arjuna’s thoughts were caused by his moha-mamata. He felt that
these were all his people. Throughout the Gita, Bhagwan explains
that nothing is ours. If the world belongs to Prakriti, it does not
belong to you. You are the asanga (non-attached) Atma; the world
is not yours. If the non-dual Brahman is the supreme Satya – pure
existence – the world has no real existence. Then, who is the
moha-mamata for? This means that it is not interaction that has
60

---

## Page 61

been cut away, and it is not the interactive world that is negated.
The sermon of the Gita removes the fault that is imbedded in your
mind, and the misconceptions of your intellect. It removes the
agitation and restlessness of your mind. It removes your moha-
mamata, and also the lack of commitment to Dharma.
I will repeat this. The Gita does the sanskara of our life by four
methods. It removes the lack of Dharma of our gross body. It
removes the moha-mamata in our mind. It removes the
restlessness and lack of faith in our causal body, and it removes
confusion regarding our essence. The Gita thus brings a sanskara
that improves and beautifies our life.
We get sullied due to misconceptions, unsteadiness, and moha-
mamata. We slip from our Dharma and get sullied. This Gita-mata
is the Mother; she oils and scrubs her child to make him clean and
lovely. She dressed him, combs his hair, and makes him beautiful.
Our Mother cleanses, beautifies, and purifies our life by removing
the faults and flaws in our life and character.

Pravachan V
Methods for Destroying the Faults in Actions and Attitudes.
The first thing I will tell you today is that all the sorrow we
experience is because of some dosha (fault) or other. That means,
dukha is created by doshas. Doshas are of four kinds – those
created by de`ha abhinive`sha (identification with the body),
those created by raaga-dve`sha (attachments-aversions), those
created by asmitaa (vanity; pride), and those created by avidyaa
(ignorance; nescience).
In the faults caused by deha abhinivesha, the person is completely
immersed in his body. ‘Nive`sha’ in Sanskrit, means ‘to sleep in’.
It is like your sleeping in your own home. You go to sleep in
yourself, for yourself, and grammatically, this becomes ‘nivesha.’
So, when your ‘I’ becomes immersed in your body, it is called
‘abhinivesha’. Identifying with the body brings many doshas and
they, in turn, bring dukha.
Let us think about the doshas that come into our life because of
this. When you identify with the body, you consider physical
comfort to be of paramount importance. That leads to lethargy,
laziness, drowsiness and forgetfulness. Then Tamo guna – the
lowly tendency of sloth and delusion – prevails.
Sleep means a loss of awareness. There is a difference between
aalasya (laziness) and pramaada (forgetfulness). Pramada is
when you don’t remember what you are supposed to do, and
alasya is when you remember what you should do, but are too
lazy to do it. That means, sleep contains unconsciousness, pramad
contains forgetfulness, and alasya makes you neglect doing your
duty. None of these are saadhan (methods) for shre`yas (that,
which brings happiness). When you sleep, you are covered by
darkness. Pramad is like being drugged, and alasya is a state of
dullness. Alasya means a lack of rasa (enjoyment) in your life. A
person who gets no pleasure in carrying out his duties is called
‘aalasee’(lazy). The letters ‘ra’ and ‘la’ are interchangeable, so a-
62

---

## Page 63

lasa and a-rasa are synonyms. An alasi’s face lacks luster, and
there is no joyfulness in his heart. However, a person who enjoys
working is never alasi. He is always eager to work.
Now, karma-pravritti (that activity of doing things) in life is also
has several kinds of doshas that we should be careful about. Sadhu
saavadhaana (good people, be careful)!
One point is that the person who works gathers wealth, but he
should be careful about how his wealth is gathered. For example,
if I want to bring this book closer to me, I will pick it up and bring
it closer. This book is a separate object that I want to bring nearer.
If I do something faulty in bringing it near, my action will become
a cause of sorrow for me. Our Shastras give three warnings about
the wealth we get. Parasya peedayaa labdham – wealth that is
obtained by making someone suffer, flouting Dharma, or at the
cost of our self-respect, should never be accepted.
Now, observe where the doshas come into the wealth. If any of
the three points mentioned above are present in the wealth that
comes into your home, you can be sure that sorrow will follow. It
cannot be predicted as to whether the sorrow will come today,
tomorrow, six months hence, or after ten years, but come it will.
The Ishwara’s account books are vast and complicated. It may be
that at first the wealth multiplies, but ultimately it is destroyed.
Not only is the wealth destroyed, the person who obtains it is also
destroyed. So, the first point to be careful about in karma-shuddhi
(purity of actions) is that nothing should enter our home unless it
is free of the three doshas mentioned above.
Now, another point. We enjoy the benefits of the things we get;
enjoying something is also a karma. People say that bhoga
(enjoying material objects or sensual pleasures) is given by
praarabdha (fate created by past actions). They talk of prarabdha,
but don’t really understand it. Prarabdha is ineffective without
karma. Suppose your prarabdha is waiting to give you the
pleasure of eating something you like very much. You will have
to pick up the food and put it into your mouth to avail of your
prarabdha. To awaken the good fortune brought by your
63

---

## Page 64

prarabdha, you need the food, you need a hand to carry it to your
mouth, and you need to chew the food to get its flavor. That
means, you need to do something to enable your prarabdha to
provide you with the bhoga it contains. Prarabdha needs both the
object and the action to fructify.
Prarabdha is merely bhoga; it is not karma. If you steal someone
else’s food, you will certainly enjoy its flavor; that will be your
bhoga. However, your action will be unethical. It will be a paapa
(sin), a fault. So, the bhoga you obtain should be within the
framework of Dharma.
Now, give some thought to dharma-maryaadaa (the boundaries of
Dharma). Dharma maryada has to be learnt, not assumed at whim
or accepted on hearsay. Dharma is absent where there are no
precepts. This is the decision that our Mahapurusha (Saints) have
reached after serious consideration.
If a soldier shoots a man at the order of his senior officer, his
action is not an offence. Sin does not attach itself to him, because
he has merely done his duty to carry out the command he was
given. It is a sin to kill; it is not Dharma to kill someone.
However, since the soldier’s action was within the framework of
the law of the land, it is not a crime. Nor does it flout Dharma. But
if a man beats up someone in anger, it becomes an offence; it is
adharma (that, which is contrary to Dharma) because it is
prompted by personal considerations.
What this means is that the actions that are within the law are
Dharma, and those that flout the rules are adharma. Tell me, now
– do you act as pushed by your vaasanaa (avid desires), or are
your actions within the constitution of Dharma? Where there is
proper governance, there is discipline. The indreeya (senses) are
restrained, and the mind is controlled. We do not indulge in
anything that does not have the sanction of Dharma. We accept
only the pleasures that Dharma permits.
To bring pavitrataa (purity and sanctity) into our karmas, we need
to have discipline. We may get bhoga according to our prarabdha,
but our actions should always adhere to our Dharma. We must
64

---

## Page 65

make sure that our hand doesn’t pick up anything impure and put
it into our mouth. Dharma-adharma come from the action of your
hand.
I told you all this to explain that firstly, inaction is a dosha. Then,
when you start doing things, it is a dosha if your actions are
prompted by avid personal desires. When doing anything, you
should be careful that you karma, bhoga and speech are not
prompted by your vasanas, and that they are within the framework
of Dharma. The faults in your karmas will be removed if this is
done.
However, if some dosha remains in your karmas, it is certain to
bring sorrow sooner or later. Wealth that is obtained by wrong
means gets destroyed, just as cotton is destroyed by fire. One day,
a man was lamenting the loss of five rupees. If you think that the
loss of five rupees is no great loss, you can consider it to be five
thousand or five lakhs! Someone asked him, ‘How did you get
this money?’ ‘Oh, I cheated someone.’ The man’s tears did not
come the day he lost the money; they came the day he stole it.
Dosha brings dukha.
In the opinion of the Gita, disinclination for work is taamasee
(filled with Tamo guna, predominated by sloth and delusion). A
person who thinks that sleep, a state of intoxication, or complete
idleness is sukha, is trapped in a tamasi sukha. The Gita says that
work is essential, and this is where we begin the first stage of life.
Doshas are divided into four basic kinds. The doshas of the
buddhi (intellect), the doshas of the aham (ego), the doshas of the
mana (emotions), and the doshas of karma (actions). Delusion is
the buddhi-dosha, the dosha of Aham is pride, and the dosha of
the mind is attachment-aversion. I will also tell you about karma-
doshas.
Indolence is the first karma-dosha. It is a dosha to avoid doing
your ordained duties. You should definitely carry out your allotted
work. A person may say, ‘Let me take a decision to do nothing at
all.’ That will not help him to attain naishkarmya (a state of
disinterestedness). A man said that he would not get out of bed,
65

---

## Page 66

but wanted to sleep soundly all day. He was told that that was not
possible unless he took sleeping pills. You need physical exertion
to sleep well.
Na karmanaamanaarambhaannaishkarmya purushoshnute`.
(3. 4)
(A person cannot obtain a state of naishkarmya by avoiding
work.)
You will not attain a state of being disinterested unless you work.
Naishkarmya is not achieved by being idle and shirking work.
There are many kinds of people in this world. A man went to a
Mahatma and said, ‘I must obtain Bhagwan! Let Bhagwan come
and give me His darshan (vision).’
‘Look, my brother,’ replied the Mahatma. ‘Bhagwan will give you
His darshan only when you have the feeling that you want only
His darshan and nothing else.’
The man sat down and said, ‘I can do nothing, and nothing can be
achieved through my efforts.’
That means, he was looking up at the sky, expecting Bhagwan to
appear before him, without any effort being made from his side!
The Mahatma rebuked him sharply. ‘Do something first!’
‘What should I do, Maharaj?’
‘Chant the Gayatri Mantra twenty four lakh times, to purify your
antahkaran (fourfold mind). Meditate as much as you can on your
Ishtadev (chosen form of worship). Undertake as many rituals of
worship as you can. When you feel utterly exhausted and feel that
you are incapable of any further effort, Bhagwan will come and
give you His darshan.’
When I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to Swami
Nityanandji, who was a disciple of Paramhansa Ramakrishna. He
asked me, ‘Have you been initiated into the Gayatri Mantra? Have
you done an anushthaana (ritual) of the Gayatri Mantra?’
I confessed that I had not done the anushthana. ‘Do the japa
(ritual chanting of a fixed number) of twenty-four lakh Gayatri
Mantra.’
66

---

## Page 67

Then, he told me, ‘Accept the initiation of a Shri Krishna Mantra
from me. Do an anushthana of this mantra.’
I did the anushthana – not once, not twice, not thrice, but four
times! I am telling you how karma brings bhagavad-prasaada
(Bhagwan’s Grace). I would get up early in the morning to do
bhajan (sing devotional songs lovingly), and get up at seven for
my bath etc. I would sit again at eight thirty and get up at eleven. I
would rest a little after lunch and sit for bhajan from two to five.
Yet I did not even get a dream of Bhagwan! It is not that –
Choree kare` nihaaya kee, karian sui ko daan,
unche` chadhakara de`khate` kittee doora vimaana.
(People steal a large piece of steel and give a needle in charity.
They go to the terrace and look to see if an air plane is coming to
take them to Heaven.)
People do a little japa and think that they have put in a great effort
for spiritual progress. They wonder why Bhagwan hasn’t come to
them! Just two days ago, someone complained that he was tired of
the rituals of worship. He wanted to know how long it would be
before Bhagwan came to him. I told him, ‘My brother, you are not
impatient for Bhagwan. You are impatient to stop doing sadhana.
Why don’t you say that you will go on with your sadhana, life
after life, until Bhagwan comes to you?’
Janama-janama lagi ragara hamaaree,
baraun shambhu na to rahaun kumaaree.
(Parvati said, ‘I am determined to marry Shambhu, even if it takes
several lifetimes of sadhana. I will remain unmarried until He
accepts me.)
‘Why doesn’t this thought come to you?’
‘Maharaj, I am in a bit of a hurry,’ he explained. ‘I want to open a
shop, after I get Bhagwan’s darshan.’
67

---

## Page 68

It doesn’t happen that way, you know! You don’t obtain Bhagwan
and then start a business! This is just an incident I narrated.
I will tell you what happened to me during my sadhana. I had
completed all the anushthanas I was told to do, without achieving
any success. I went to the Gangaji for a bath, placing my mala on
the bank before going into the waters. A crow picked up my mala
and flew off. He dropped it into the Gangaji. ‘It is all over for
me,’ I thought. ‘Rama came as a crow and threw my mala into the
Gangaji. I will do no more japa.’
Then came the thought that I was a great paapee (sinner), I had
many doshas; how could I ever meet Bhagwan? Let me run away
from home and go to the Himalayas.
I left home quietly. I had walked for about twenty-five miles when
a relative caught me, barefooted and bareheaded, and exhausted.
He brought me to his house and then took me to see a cinema.
Tears of frustration welled up in me. The following day I locked
myself in a room and gave way to my tears. I wept bitterly,
because I felt that I had no chance of meeting Bhagwan in this
life. I did not cry deliberately to please the Ishwara. There was no
sadhana-buddhi in my weeping. My tears were effortless and they
were destroying my aham. I went on weeping for a long time and
then I had an amazing experience.
I will not tell you about my experience. What I want to tell you is
that if you believe that there is no need for you to make any effort,
that everything will be done by Bhagwan, it is a fallacy. The
principle is that we must make every possible effort. When our
capacity for further effort is exhausted, that is when Bhagwan’s
kripaa (Grace) begins.
Na karmanaamanaarambhaannaishkarmyam purushoshnute`.
If you make no effort, do no sadhana, you cannot obtain
naishkarmya. If you work hard, you will sleep well. If you do an
upavaasa (fast), you will have a good appetite. If you do your
68

---

## Page 69

work with the right attitude, you will be freed from the bondage of
work.
Na karmanaamanaarambhaannaishkarmyam purushoshnute`,
Na cha sanyasanaade`va siddhim samadhigachhati.
(3. 4)
(No one can attain a state of naishkarmya or Yoganishtha unless
he begins to work for it. Nor can anyone obtain siddhi by giving
up work.)
If someone just takes the vows of Sanyas, and sits apart doing
nothing, he cannot get siddhi (success). If he goes to the forest, he
will carry that same mind and senses with him.
There was a Seth (wealthy businessman) from Ratanghar. He
came to Vrindavan, leaving everything behind, saying he wanted
to do Bhagwan’s bhajan. He used to have a little cloth bag
dangling from his wrist, in which he kept his mala, to do japa
continuously. After some days, he convinced some other Seths
that they should build an Ashram at Vrindavan. He would stand in
the hot sun, holding an umbrella in his left hand and his mala on
his right wrist. He would count the donkeys that came loaded with
bricks, and count the bricks they brought. It was laughable – he
had come to Vrindavan to do bhajan, but he spent his time
counting donkeys and bricks! Had he stayed at home he would
have counted notes. He died a few days later. His vaasanaa (avid
desire) for material objects stayed with him when he came to
Vrindavan. This is not tyaaga (renunciation).
And, there was a Sanyasi who went and sat under a tree in a
lonely spot to do bhajan. A crow who was sitting on a branch of
the tree spattered him with dung. The Sanyasi gathered some
stones and decided he would not let the crow sit on the branch.
Every time the crow flew towards the tree, he would throw a stone
to drive it away. The day was spent in chasing away the crow
instead of doing bhajan!

Na cha sannyaasanaade`va siddhim samadhigachhati.
Siddhi is not achieved by just taking Sanyas or renouncing
worldly activities. The mind has to be cultivated. Effort is needed
to purify the mind, not from just one viewpoint but from many
viewpoints. Please see the third chapter. Bhagwan has given some
twenty reasons to establish that a human being should not give up
doing his duties. He should understand what his duties are, and
carry them out to become free of karma-dosha.
Niyatam kuru karmatvam karma jyaayo hyakarmanah,
shareera yaatraapi cha te` na prasiddhye`dakarmanah.
(3. 8)
(Go on doing your duty as ordained by the Shastras, because it is
better to be active than to be idle. You can’t even sustain your
body if you do no work.)
‘Tvam – O human being!’ Only a human being is eligible for the
Gita’s message. You are aware of this fact. It is one of the Gita’s
special aspects. You may ask, ‘Only humans are eligible for all
Shastras – why just the Gita?’ The answer is that according to the
Shastras, only Brahmins are eligible for doing the Vrihaspati Sava
Yagya; only Kings are eligible for doing the Rajasuya Yagya, and
only Vaishyas are eligible for doing the Vaishyastoma Yagya.
Other people are not allowed to do these rituals. However, as far
as the Gita is concerned, all Bhagwan’s children are eligible, and
every person is Bhagwan’s child. The Gita tells us, ‘Work, my
child!’ Just as a father teaches his son to be hardworking, the
Parameshwara is telling us to fulfill our ordained tasks – niyatam
kuru karma tvam.
Bhagwan gives this teaching to all simultaneously. What teaching
does He give? ‘Nityam kuru karma tvam karma jyaayo
hyakarmanah. O human being! You should definitely do your
ordained duties.’ The emphasis is on doing the work that is right
for us. It is better to work than to avoid working.

I want to tell you about something that gives me deep pain. I say
this from my viewpoint, expressing my anguish. Those who
refuse to believe in the karma-sanskaara (rituals done to create
beneficial sanskaras) to remove their vikaara (mental distortions),
are not on the right path. For example, adultery is a karma, telling
a lie is a karma, and stealing is a karma. When a person’s vikara
reaches the stage of action, he goes on doing things that are
wrong. His mind is filled with the wrong kinds of sanskaras. If he
avoids doing the karmas that are recommended by the Shastras for
removing mental doshas and vikaras he will never be free of them.
He may say, ‘Oh, I have placed my trust in Bhagwan. He will do
with me as He pleases.’ Or, ‘I have put aside my antahkaran, and
sit as the saakshee-drashtaa (an uninvolved observer).’ Such a
person may remain in a detached state for a while, but the vikaras
will crowd back into his mind as soon as he comes out of that
state. He will fall prey once again to the same desires, anger and
greed as before. He will do the same wrong actions, driven by his
mental distortions.
This is why it is essential to conscientiously do the karmas that
remove the cheating, lack of integrity, lies, promiscuity, and
misbehavior from our lives. We need to do this to cultivate good
traits and lead a noble, upright life. Narayana! Please understand
this well. If anyone tells you, ‘You are the sakshi drashta, so you
have no need to curtail the wrong actions done by your body,’ he
is leading you astray. You chose to bring wrong actions into your
life. Their effect will not be erased by leaving things to the
Ishwara, or by convincing yourself that you are a detached
observer of the actions of your body. You have to make an effort
to improve your life and mind. People talk about climbing to the
roof of the palace, without placing their foot on the first step!
Your aalasya-pramaada (laziness and forgetting your duty) will
be removed when your actions become pure. When you cultivate
karma-shuddhi (the ability to work in a pure manner) your bhoga,
speech, and accumulation will also be pure.
71

---

## Page 72

Those who use the excuse of depending on Bhagwan – or being
the drashta – to avoid changing their habits can never get rid of
their doshas and vikaras. So, satkarma (right actions) are essential
if you want to remove your doshas. How? If you do satkarma, the
first benefit is the curtailment of excessive sleep, laziness, and
forgetting your duty. Secondly, you will not succumb to the
temptation of stealing, cheating, telling lies, or being violent.
Thirdly, the doshas in your bhoga will be removed. Fourthly,
faults in speech will be removed. And fifthly, your karmas will be
pure. When you begin to work in the right way, you will be free of
the five doshas. Then, the sorrows that come because of these
doshas will not come into your life.
Now, let us see what the Gita says about the doshas in bhaava
(feelings), and the method of their removal.
Karmanye`vaadhikaaraste` maa fale`shu kadaachana,
maa karmafalahe`turbhoormaa te` sangostvakarmani.
(2. 47)
(You have the right only to do your work, you have no right over
the fruit of the work you do. So, don’t consider yourself to be the
cause of the fruit of your work, and don’t be attached to the work
either.)
See how the Gita takes the second step, by saying, ‘Maa fale`shu
kadaachana’ (the fruit is not in your hands). This is the removing
of the dosha of the desire in your mind. I want to make it clear to
you that if you want to retain the doshas in your life, and also
attain spiritual upliftment, it can’t be done. Don’t say that your
wrong tendencies are carried over from past lives. The Gita does
not talk about the liberation that will be attained in the future
lives. Your excuses indicate that you don’t really want to be
liberated. A person who wants to be liberated will have to put in
an effort! You are willing to put in an effort to earn money, obtain
pleasures, and build a house; but for spiritual progress you expect
someone to come and put his hand on your head, and shower
72

---

## Page 73

Grace on you! To hope for effortless upliftment is as foolish as
expecting your money to be doubled magically. Every intelligent
person understands that notes cannot be doubled. If they are, they
will be counterfeit, having the same numbers, and they will be
illegitimate.
Therefore, the upliftment done by hypnosis or mesmerism – or by
making you unconscious – is no upliftment. It will not endure; nor
will it purify your mind. Bhagwati Gita tells you to remove your
doshas by doing karmas. Pay attention to this –
Yatah pravrittirbhootaanaam ye`na sarvamidam tatam,
svakarmanaa tamabhyarcha siddhim vindati maanavah.
(18. 46)
(All beings are created from the Paramatma who pervades the
whole world. By worshipping Him through all your activities and
actions, you will obtain the supreme state.)
What is the purpose of the work you do? You say, ‘O wealth, I am
working to obtain you. Please come into my house. O pleasures, I
strive for you – please come into my life. O chair (position), I am
working hard for you. Please be pleased, and let me occupy you.’
When you use your karma for worldly benefits, it does not feel
pleased with you. It sits and weeps.
Why?
Because you are connecting it to paltry substances.
Then, what should karma be connected to?
Connect your karma to that, which is greater than karma.
Svakarmanaa tamabhyarchya siddhim vindati maanavah.
Do your work with the feeling that you are worshipping the
Parameshwara through the work you do. Tam abhyarcha.
Abhyarcha is greater than archanaa (ritual offering). The worship
of the Ishwara in all four directions. Whatever you do, like
sweeping the floor etc, is a worship of the Ishwara. Grazing the
73

---

## Page 74

cows, manufacturing materials, farming, or any other work is a
worship of the Ishwara.
How can these be worship of the Ishwara?
The thing is that the Ishwara is everywhere.
Yatah pravrittirbhootaanaam ye`na sarvamidam tatam,
svakarmanaa tamabhyarchya siddhim vindati maanavah.
If you can see this, this is the shuddhi (purification) of bhaava
(feeling).
How is bhava purified?
Do you work for the sake of your son? Are your efforts intended
to improve your health and physique? Are you working to make
your body – of bones, flesh and skin – more beautiful? Are you
working for the fulfillment of personal desires? Bhagwan tells us
to do our work, but not for the sake of our own children, pleasures
and indulgences. We should not permit ourselves to indulge in
wrong acts like stealing, or anything that is unethical or immoral.
Our goal should be pavitra (pure and sanctified). Our work should
be done for pleasing the Ishwara.
When the purpose of your work is pavitra, its essence will be
pavitra. Then, the work will not be done for personal pleasure.
Nor will there be any scope for unethical practices. Your work
will be pure. The doshas of drowsiness, indolence, and forgetting
your duty will be removed from your life. You will not
accumulate wrong things. So, work with the understanding that –
Yatah pravrittirbhootaanaam ye`na sarvamidam tatam,
‘Through the work I do, I worship that formless Parameshwara
who is seated in my heart, who I cannot see, and who rules me.’
Just as electricity cannot be seen but it makes the fan revolve and
the bulb light up, the power that enables our movements – yatah
pravrittirbhootaanam – is one.
74

---

## Page 75

And, ye`na sarvamidam tatam – the entire world is His essence.
The Paramatma manages everyone. When you see everything
with the Ishwara drishti (the viewpoint of the Ishwara) in your
work, your work will be filled with the Ishwara. As soon as the
feeling of working for the Ishwara comes, all your doshas – like
desire, anger, and greed – will be removed. Your work will
become pure.
Now, how will the doshas caused by the ego of individuality – the
ahamtaa and asmitaa – be removed?
Tame`va sharam gachha sarvabhaave`na bhaarata.
(18. 62)
(O Bharat! Shelter in that Parameshwara in every way.)
The Gita gives many methods for removing ahamtaa (the ego),
but only one method for removing the dosha of the buddhi, which
is bhraanti (wrong understanding). The Gita gives three methods
for removing ahamta and asmita. I will tell you about them
tomorrow.

Pravachan VI
Cultivating good sanskaras and removing doshas.
The Gita is a Shastra. It shows us the methods for improving our
sanskaras. The fact is that the Shastra is not meant to be restricted
to words in books; it is meant to bring sanskaras into our life, and
remove the dukha in it. The Shastras would have no utility for us
if they did not cleanse and improve our life, make it more
beautiful, and bring into it what is lacking. The Shastras solve our
dilemmas and remove our doubts. They are to be experienced in
our life. It is through them that the impurities that have come into
our lives are removed.
I will tell you something that should actually have been told later
on. The faults that have seeped into your life will not be destroyed
by your becoming mentally detached for a short while. A method
must be used for the doshas to be removed. If you have doshas,
don’t disdain them thinking them to be insignificant.
Ripu ruja paavaka paapa prabhu ahi ganiye` na chota kari.
An enemy, disease, fire, sin, snake or king should never be
underestimated, because they all have great power to do harm.
Now, the essence of this Atma of ours is Gnan, but our Gnan has
merged into the doshas that have been superimposed on our mind.
As a result, the doshas come into our karmas. So, the first thing
that the Gita teaches us is that we should not ignore our doshas.
We should try to remove the doshas like raaga-dve`sha
(attachments-aversions), kaama-krodha (desire-anger),
vvyabhichaara-hinsaa (profligacy-violence), and choree-
be`imaani (stealing-cheating).
If you wish to do your sanskaras from the viewpoint of the Gita,
observe your doshas. If you want to remove sorrow from your
life, it is vital that you cultivate the sanskaras that remove your
doshas. So, examine the source of your doshas.
76

---

## Page 77

The Gnan that leads to raga-dvesha is a dosha, since it creates
attachment and hatred. We favor the people we love and become
callous towards those we dislike. This is a dosha of the
antahkaran, and it creates sorrow. We feel sorry when things don’t
go according to our preference.
If we discuss the matter with the acceptance of previous lives,
then these doshas – raga-dvesha, kama-krodha, vyabhichara-
hinsa, etc – come from within, and manifest externally. If we
discuss the matter rejecting past births, the doshas come into our
lives through our senses. We have to offer a logical explanation
even for those who do not believe in rebirth, like Muslims and
Christians, about how doshas come into our lives.
Don’t focus on where the doshas come from; think about whether
they are present in your life or not. It is not a sign of great
intelligence to throw our doshas into the past. It is also wrong to
put the blame on other people, saying, ‘He taught me about love
and hate.’ Nor is it proper to say that your likes and dislikes are
inherited from your parents. It is you who have cultivated doshas
through the things you have seen and heard. Doshas come into the
indreeya (senses) first, and then they enter the mind. After that
you merge with them. What you should examine is whether you
have doshas or not.
Mahaashano mahaapaapmaa viddhaye`namiha vairinam.(3. 37)
(Desire has an appetite that can never be satisfied, no matter how
much a person indulges. It is a great sinner. Know it to be your
enemy.)
You don’t recognize your enemy. ‘What harm can he do to me?’
you ask. This enemy will not do anything, but it will cut up your
heart totally. No Brahmagnan or enlightenment can be achieved
unless doshas are removed.
There is a Raja Saheb who is my devotee. He had some guests
who were foreigners. They told him, ‘Go and ask Swamiji, that
we are prepared to listen to his teaching provided he does not
interfere with our food habits and lifestyle. If he agrees to this
77

## Page 78

condition, we are willing to learn Brahmagnan from him. We will
learn how to do yogaa and dhyaanam .’ Well, now! Only those
who want to increase their following would accept such
conditions! Such people say, ‘I will teach you dhyaanam, whether
you believe in the Ishwara or not. You are at liberty to eat and
drink what you want. You need not change your lifestyle. All that
has nothing to do with the dhyaanam I will teach you.’ When
people want to profit, they talk like this, but no Sadhu or Mahatma
will say such a thing.
I speak frankly, my brother. The Mahatmas who live in the
Himalayas have no desires or worldly concerns. They are quite
likely to turn their back – or run away into the forest – if some
rich man comes to them. I have associated with such Mahatmas. I
have no hesitation in speaking openly, even about the dirtiest
thing in public.
Kaama e`sha krodha e`sha rajoguna samudbhavah,
mahaashano mahaapaapmaa viddhye`namiha vairinam.
(3. 37)
(Shri Bhagwan said, ‘Kama is born from Rajo guna – the mixed
tendency, and it is krodha. It has an insatiable appetite, and is a
great paapi. Know it to be your enemy.’)
Bhagwan Shri Krishna says that one dosha has come before you
in two forms. One form is mahashano (having a great appetite)
and the other is mahapaapma (a great sinner). It is one dosha that
comes as both kama and krodha. Desire is never satiated, and
anger is a great sinner. Desires are unending; hatred, anger and
violence make people do great harm.
Let the Ishwara remain where he is, and let Brahmagnan remain in
the books of Vedanta. Let asangataa (non-attachment) remain in
the homes of the Yogis. If you wish to enhance your life as a
human being, you must first understand the nature of the doshas.
You must know your enemy – ‘Viddhye`namiha vaireenam.’

This dosha has covered your Gnan the way smoke hides fire. Fire
is not completely hidden by smoke; it is only partially hidden. Nor
does dust hide the mirror completely. A saattvik aavarana (a
covering predominated by Sattva guna, the lofty tendency) is
compared to fire and smoke. A rajas aavarana (a covering
predominated by Rajo guna, the mixed tendency) is compared to
the dust on a mirror. And, a taamasee aavarana (a covering
predominated by Tamo guna, the lowly tendency) is compared to
the fetus in the womb that is completely covered by the placenta.
Aavritam gnaaname`te`na gnaanino nityavairinaa.
(3. 39)
(And, O Arjuna! Gnan is covered by desire, which is like the fire
that flares up when it is fed.)
The Gnan of people is concealed. This is the Upanishad. What
does the Upanishad indicate? It tells you that your essence is
Gnan, but the Gnan has been colored with your desires and
dislikes. Recognize your enemies – their names are kama and
krodha. Their work is mahashano and mahapaapma. They cover
up your Gnan.
And, where do they stay?
Indriyaani manobuddhirasyaadhishthaanamuchyate`.
(3. 40)
(The senses [indriya], mind [mana] and intellect [buddhi] are said
to be their abodes.)
Kama and krodha abide in our senses, mind and intellect. They
first come into the senses, then into the mind, and then establish
themselves in the intellect.

Take the example of a rathee (the owner of the chariot). You want
to sit on your chariot to go somewhere, but your enemy has made
friends with the horses by feeding them. He has your saarathee
(driver) on his payroll. How will you reach your destination? The
buddhi is the sarathi, the mind is the reins, and the sense organs
are the horses. [The chariot is your body, and you – the jeevatma
– are the owner.]
I will tell you about an excellent guard dog who made sure that no
thief could enter his master’s house at night. Some thieves began
to give him chunks of meat and bowls of milk during the day
when he was left free in the compound. The dog soon began to
wag his tail whenever he saw them. Having made friends with the
dog, they had nothing to fear. They came one night and stole all
they could, without the dog giving any warning to its master. So,
what is this? The indriyas are our horses, the mind is the reins that
control them, and the intellect is the driver that guides our chariot.
Ettairvimohayatye`sha gnaanamaavritya de`hinam.
(3. 40)
(The Gnan of human beings is covered up by their desires. Desire
uses the mind, intellect, and senses to delude the jeevatma – the
Atma attached to a body.)
This is why people become deluded.
Tasmaattvamindriyaanyaadau niyamya bharatarshabha,

(3. 41)
(Therefore, O Arjuna, you should first control your senses. Then
you will definitely succeed in destroying kama, the great sinner
and destroyer of your Gnan and vigyaana.)
If you hope to obtain the Paramatma without controlling your
senses, you are rejecting the tradition of the Upanishads. You are
succumbing to temptation, thinking that you will be free to eat and
drink what you like, and also obtain the Ishwara! You feel that
you will not need to do Satsang (go to discourses) or control
80

## Page 81

unethical actions; that you will be free to cheat people in business,
drink at the Club and womanize freely. The Ishwara will come to
you with folded hands and say, ‘Sethji, I have come to offer My
services.’
To obtain the Ishwara, you have to make yourself beautiful and
attractive, and then He will be pleased with you. So, in
‘Tasmaattvamindritaanyaadau’, what is the meaning of ‘aadau’?
It means that you have to control the intellect and the mind.
All right, put the Ishwara aside for a while. If you want to
improve yourself, make yourself beautiful and be a respected
member of society, you will have to quiet your senses first. Unless
your senses are quiet and controlled, your life will be like the life
of a wayward antisocial or drunkard, not like that of a cultured
gentleman.
There was a Mahatma at Kashi. Just was we say, ‘Shree
gane`shaaya namah’ when staring something, he would say, ‘Om
namah kalaye`dharmanaashaaya vigrahaaya - I bow down to the
Kali Yuga, the age of Kali that has manifested to destroy the
tradition of Dharma.’ Who is the herald of the Kali Yuga? It is
that, which cannot make you a virtuous gentleman who leads an
ethical life. How can that send you to Swarga in your next birth?
It is absolutely wrong to say that you will be provided with a letter
that will open the gates of Heaven for you.
Tasmaattvamindriyaanyaadau niyamya bharatarshabha,
paapmaanam prajahi hye`nam gnaanvignaananaashanam.
(3. 41)
(Therefore, O Arjuna, control your senses first. Then you will
definitely succeed in destroying the sinful kama that destroys your
Gnan and vignana.)
Give up this paapee (sinner), and know yourself. Know that you
are that, which is beyond the senses, mind and intellect.

(3. 42 – 43)
(The senses are said to be beyond the gross body; that is, they are
stronger and more subtle than the gross body. The mind is beyond
the senses, and the intellect is beyond the mind. That, which is
beyond even the intellect, is the Atma.
Thus, know the subtle Atma that is beyond even the intellect, and
is stronger as well as superior to it. Control the mind with the
intellect, O mighty-armed Arjuna, and destroy the desire that is
your real enemy.)
‘Don’t be ruled by your senses, mind and intellect. Know the
essence of the Atma that is beyond these, and destroy kama.
Control your senses and renounce desires.’ Thus, two things have
been said here.
Since you read the Gita I am telling you that nobody can be a
worthy person or a sadhak without controlling his senses. The
encouragement given to wrong habits and activities is for personal
gain; there is no other reason for it. So, the Gita tells you to
improve your own lifestyle.
Uddhare`daatmanaatmaanam naatmaanamavasaadaye`t,
aatmaiva hyaatmano banduraatmaiva ripuraatmanah.
(6. 5)
(Lift yourself up out of the sea of this world by your own efforts.
Don’t let yourself sink lower into it, because a man is his own
friend and also his own enemy.)
You are a human being. Get up and stand upright. ‘Uttishata
jaagrata praapya varaanbodhata.’ You will get success. Don’t be
disheartened, thinking that you will never succeed in controlling
your senses. Don’t consider yourself incapable of success or
progress. Wake up! Arise, and go forth. You will achieve your
purpose.

I will now tell you another point about aatma-sanskaara
(improving yourself). This is the method of Yoga. To make every
effort for disciplining yourself is the path to success. You are
aware that from the viewpoint of the philosophy of the Yoga
Darshan, the drashtaa (uninvolved witness) is established in
himself.
Tadaa drashtuh svaroope`vasthaanam. (Yoga Darshan 1.3)
When the chittavritti (mental tendencies) are blocked, the drashtaa
becomes established in his Self. If you use the method of Yoga for
your sadhana, you will become established in your essence. You
will then become free of wrong actions. I tell you this frankly.
Like Bachubhai, I ask your forgiveness beforehand for speaking
frankly.
Naavirato dushchaitaan naashaanto na samaahitah,
naashaantamaanaso vaapi pragnaane`naivamaapnuyaat.
(Katha Upanishad 1. 2. 24)
The first sadhan is to give up all immoral actions. The rule of the
Yoga Darshan is to develop the Yoga of controlling all mental
movements by practicing the eight steps of yama (restraining the
senses), niyama (external disciplines), aasana (Yogic exercises),
praanaayaama (breath control exercises), pratyaahaara
(withdrawing the mind from the external world), dhaaranaa
(bringing the mind repeatedly to the object of meditation),
dhyaana (meditating) and Samadhi (deep meditation). This is the
state of nirodha (blocking mental movements), and the one who
observes this state of his own mind is the drashta, established in
his own Self.
And, what happens when the mental tendencies leave the nirodha
dashaa (state of nirodha)? Vrittisaaroopyaitaratra (Yoga Darshan
1. 4). The drashta merges into the normal mental inclinations once
again. Pay attention to this mind of yours – do you follow yama-
niyama? Do you adhere to satya (the truth), ahinsaa
83

---

## Page 84

(nonviolence), aste`ya (not coveting what belongs to another),
brahmacharya (celibacy) and aparigraha (avoiding unnecessary
accumulation)? Do you adhere to the disciplines of shaucha
(external purity), santosha (being satisfied with what you have),
tapasyaa (asceticism), svaadhyaaya (studying the Shastras), and
eeshvara praanidhaana (bowing to the Ishwara)? Are you
established in your Self as a drashta after following these, or
without following them?
You will succeed in becoming free of immoral actions only if you
follow these practices and sit as a drashta, because these
disciplines have the affect of removing wrong actions. When
mental tendencies are blocked, mental agitations are also
removed. The drashta, who observes your disdaining of all wrong
actions and urges, is your Atma.
That is very good, but it is unacceptable that a person becomes a
drashta for five minutes, a profligate for five minuets, a cheat for
five minutes, and a thief for five minuets! A thief is not a drashta
and the drashta is not a thief! You may say, ‘Maharaj, the urge to
steal keeps coming – I only observe it.’ I will tell you to curb your
urge to steal by practicing yama-niyama.
I tell you two things – the first is to do Karmayoga. Let all your
actions be worship, for removing faults like kama and krodha. The
second is to practice Yoga (attaching yourself to Bhagwan)
through the method of Ashtanga Yoga (the eight step Yoga), and
establish yourself as the drashta. This Yoga inculcates beneficial
sanskaras.
The purpose of Karmayoga is also to enhance yourself. The
purpose of Bhaktiyoga and Gnanyoga is the same. How does
Gnanyoga improve and beautify? It removes the dosha of wrong
understanding from our intellect.
When you do anything systematically, you will reach the fruit of
the work. Pay attention to these five doshas in your life – stealing,
accumulation, indulgences, violence, and falsehood. To
accumulate more than you need means a greed for possessions. To
take something that is not rightfully yours is also greed. That
84

---

## Page 85

means, greed has two offspring – one bad daughter and one bad
son. The bad daughter is ste`ya (stealing). A greedy person is sure
to steal. And, the bad son is parigraha (accumulation). A greedy
person is sure to accumulate possessions.
Now, see; kama means bhoga – indulging in pleasures and
luxuries. What is the offspring of kama? Excessive desire leads to
improper indulgences, while controlled desire results in
indulgence that is within the framework of Dharma. Practicing
brahmacharya (celibacy) according to out Ashram (stage of life)
controls desire.
Hinsa is the daughter of krodha, while our tendency for asatya
(falsehood) leads to prevarication. Don’t think that telling lies is
unimportant. When someone tells a lie it means that he believes
that his purpose can be achieved through falsehood. If his intellect
accepts that falsehood is something very important for him, he
will not be interested in the truth.
The principle, ‘I should love satya (the Truth) and I should obtain
the Satya,’ will have no appeal for someone who considers
falsehood to be the right method for his success. The desire for
knowing the truth will never awaken in such a person. Why
should anyone who values falsehood wish to obtain the Satya
Paramatma, a lifestyle of truth, the Brahman – the Satya that is the
Supreme? So, a person who lacks love for satya has no wish to
obtain the Paramatma.
A person who has hatred in his heart holds on to anger, is envious
of others, makes no effort to obtain mental peace, and is
engrossed in his own desires and pleasures. Such a person is a
slave. People go on living unethically, saying, ‘Oh, I am pure
consciousness.’ What will such consciousness achieve? How long
will it last? It is only when a person uses the method of Yoga,
removes his doshas by practicing ahinsa, asteya, brahmacharya,
and aparigraha; then maintains the disciplines of yama, niyama,
asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and Samadhi that
he can be established in his essence as the drashta. Then he will
develop the lofty characteristics.

## Page 86

We will take up another aspect of this. You want to improve
yourself. One point is, how to improve the work you do, and the
second point is, how to improve in Yoga. Now, the third point is
that Bhagwan’s bhakti should come into your life, to bring
sanskaras into it. Bhakti is a great sanskara of our life.
To make yourself pure is aatma-sanskaara. What you are, should
be made pure. Don’t try to make the Brahman pure – the Brahman
is already pure! Purify yourself! Apply oil and soap to make your
skin soft and clean. You can make the Brahman soft and clean
later!
Maam hi paartha vyapaashritya ye`pi syuh paapayonayah,
striyo vaishyaastathaa shoodraaste`pi yaanti paraam gatim.
Kim punarbraahmanaah punyaa bhaktaa raajarshayastathaa,
anityamasukham lokamimam praapya bhajasva maam.
(9. 32 -33)
(O Arjuna! Whoever takes refuge in Me obtains the Supreme
State, whether it is a woman, a Vaishya (trader class), Shudra
(labor class), or someone born in a lower strata due to past sins.
That being the case, what doubt is there that if a Brahmin, or a
bhakta born in a princely home will attain the Supreme State if he
takes refuge in Me? Therefore, think of Me lovingly and
constantly while you are in this transient physical form that has no
enduring happiness.)
Bhagwan says that even if a man was a sinner in his past life –
paapayonayah – he can destroy his past sins by doing Bhagwan’s
bhajan and bringing sanskaras into his life. Even the impurity of
being born to a prostitute, or some lower class, will be removed
by Bhagwan’s bhakti. Bhakti washes all impurities away.
Someone may say that he is only concerned with the present life.
Bhagwan says –
Api che`tsuduraachaaro bhajate` maamananyabhaak,
sadhure`va sa mantavyah samyagvyavasito hi sah.
Kshipram bhavati dharmaatmaa shashvachhaantim nigachhati,
86

---

## Page 87

kaunte`ya pratijaaneehi na me` bhaktah pranashyati.
(9. 30 -31)
(If even the greatest of all sinners worships Me continuously and
lovingly, he is worthy of being called a Sadhu, because he has
come to the right conclusion that nothing can compare with
Bhagwan’s bhajan.
Such a man becomes a pious person very quickly. He attains
everlasting supreme peace. O Arjuna! Know it to be true that My
bhakta is never destroyed.)
A wicked man who begins to worship Bhagwan lovingly and
continuously soon becomes pious. From where did this sanskara –
bhajate` maamananyabhaak – come into our life? Bhakti for
Bhagwan intensifies when we take His support for doing His
bhajan. I will explain the science of this. What do you really
want? Weigh your heart with honesty. There is no need to tell me
what is in it, but what you truly want is not hidden from you.
When a person has a desire for the all-pervading, omniscient
Ishwara, who inspires all and abides in all hearts, who is just and
supremely merciful – then the Parameshwara will be in the womb
of his desire. When a man wants a prostitute, the prostitute is in
the womb of his desire. When he wants to meet a gangster, the
gangster is in the womb of his desire. so, when you want the
Paramatma, the Paramatma will come and sit in the womb of your
desire. He will manifest in your mind.
What does it mean, to manifest in the mind? You are aware about
ichhaa-vritti. Just as a baby is in the mother’s womb, the ichhaa
(desire) is in the womb of the ichhaa-vritti (the mental inclination
to obtain something). Desire is never without an object; it is
always pregnant. When we have a thirst for something, the image
of that object comes and gets established in our mind. What is the
image of desire? It is that, what you want.
Do you want to obtain the Ishwara? Yes! Declare fearlessly that it
is the Ishwara you truly want. There is no delay in obtaining the
Ishwara, but a true longing for Him is rare. So much so that desire
does not spare even the Vedantis!
87

## Page 88

How so?
Jigyaasaa means a desire for Gnan. ‘Satyam gnaanam anantam
brahm’. According to this Vedic statement, the essence of the
Paramatma is Gnan. A desire for Gnan is a desire to know the
Ishwara. When we have a desire to know the Ishwara, all other
desires disappear automatically. Isn’t this a sanskara?
A man wanted to kill his enemy, he wanted to win the love of a
beautiful woman, and he wanted to become rich. The enemy, the
beautiful woman, and wealth were in the womb of the desire of
this man. Now, if he got a desire for the Ishwara, the Ishwara
would come into the womb of his desire, removing all other
desires. Only one desire can exist at a time. The mind cannot
desire two things simultaneously. As long as your mind dwells on
the Ishwara, the desire for the Ishwara will fill your mind.
You say that you are not able to meditate. How can your mind
remain steady on the Ishwara unless you have a desire for Him?
The mind has no problem in focusing on the one we love.
So, see how the desire for the Ishwara enhances our life, removes
all the dirt in it, and makes our antahkaran refined and upright.
Desire for bhakti purifies and beautifies our heart. Let bhakti
come into your heart! Bhakti is an emotional thirst for Bhagwan.
It is a continuous process of yearning and satisfaction, from only
Bhagwan, and no other. Bhagwan’s bhakti is divided into these
two parts – thirst for Him and satisfaction in Him.
Look at the sanskaras of your antahkaran! The sanskara of a
human life is Dharma. The sanskara of the antahkaran is bhakti,
and the sanskara of his state is Yoga – meaning, to be established
as the drashta.
Now, regarding Brahmagnan –
Na hi gnaane`na sadrisham pavitramiha vidyate`,
tatsvayam yogasansiddhih kaale`naatmani vindati.
(4. 38)
(There is nothing in this world like Gnan, for making yourself
pure. A person whose antahkaran has become pure after several
88

---

## Page 89

lifetimes of Karmayoga obtains Gnan automatically, within
himself.)
For enhancing your intellect, living wisely, and purifying your
lifestyle, there is no better method than Gnan. Gnan makes a
person’s life pavitra (pure and holy) by removing faulty
understanding. Delusion results in avid desires rising up. Desires
lead to mental agitation and wrong inclinations. However, even
Vedanta has to be learnt by the proper method, to make your life,
antahkaran, and character beautiful and pure. If you read or listen
to Vedanta at random, and consider yourself to be a Vedanti, you
are likely to get trapped in ‘Asi brahm tusi brahm’ (I am the
Brahman and you are also the Brahman), and indulge in
wrongdoing. Then Vedanta will achieve nothing.
Do you know what the first condition in Vedanta is? It is a pure
antahkaran. So, you need to purify your antahkaran through the
traditional methods of Dharma, upaasanaa (ritual worship), and
Yoga. You need to develop the four sadhans (efforts for spiritual
progress) of vive`ka (discrimination) vairaagya (renunciation),
shatsmapatti (the six virtues of inner and outer restraint, lack of
interest in worldly considerations, forbearance, faith and proper
understanding), and mumukshaa (a desire to be liberated form
rebirth). You also need to purify your intellect by the methods of
shravana (listening to discourses), manana (pondering upon
them) and nididhyaasana (bringing the mind repeatedly to
Bhagwan). If you do all these, and your antahkaran becomes pure,
the brahmaakaaravritti (inclination for the Brahman) will rise
automatically, and reveal to you that the Atma and the Brahman
are one.
You will have the direct experience of the mahaavaakya (the
ultimate statement of the Vedas that says that nothing exists
except the Brahman). If you take in Vedanta by the ordained
method, it will make your life pure. However, if you are trapped
by the allurement, ‘You can continue with your immoral
89

---

## Page 90

activities, and I will pick up the Brahman and put It into your
pocket,’ such Vedanta will be useless.
Therefore, all these Dharma Shastras, Upanishad Shastras, Yoga
Shastras and Vedanta Shastra do the sanskara of our life. They
improve our lives. They make us refined and ethical. They make
us pure. Those who do not use the proper method of studying
them become self-proclaimed Vedantis. They lose their balance of
mind, because their antahkaran has not being purified
methodically. They think that they have merged into the
saakshee-che`tan (the consciousness that is the uninvolved
witness), but become wicked people.
The Shastras give us sanskaras, and the sanskaras remove the
doshas in our life, and when the doshas are removed, sorrow is
also removed.
Now, I will tell you how the Gita does the sanskara of our life.

## Page 91

Pravachan VII
The removal of the doshas of the antahkaran.
Ordinary people tend to focus on the qualities of the object.
People who are more astute tend to give more attention to the
karma, but it is a little hard to focus on one’s self.
We have a brahmachaari (celibate student) who was told that
eating dhania (powdered coriander seeds) is very good for health.
He began to eat large quantities of dhania every day, with the
result that it had an adverse affect on his health. So, a person who
focuses on the quality of the object sees it from an incomplete
point of view. There was another gentleman. He heard that fasting
is good for health. He was not robust, so he fell ill when he began
to fast frequently. The purpose of telling you this is that whether
the sadhana is eating or fasting; whether it is doing work or
withdrawing from work, the eligibility of the individual needs to
be taken into consideration. People usually fail to realize this.
Regarding fasting, it is the rule that fasting is beneficial only for
healthy people; not for someone who is ill or emaciated. In the
same way, one has to give thought to which sadhana is suitable
for which person. For example, someone asked, ‘Which is the best
sadhana?’
‘The one in which you don’t have to make any effort.’
‘I will undertake that sadhana with full zeal!’
That is not likely to bring success!
You work for the fulfillment of your desires. You work to obtain
pleasures, objects, popularity and fame. You strive to achieve
these worldly goals. But what do you do to obtain the Ishwara?
Nothing! You sit in silence, but sitting in silence will not give you
the conviction that you are progressing towards the Ishwara. As
long as you believe that you have to do something to get
something, you will achieve nothing by sitting in silence.
91

---

## Page 92

The first point is to give your attention to the object of your
desire. What do you really want? Next, give thought to whether
you have the eligibility to obtain what you want. The third point is
to make sure that you have the right understanding of the
relationship between the saadhaka (spiritual seeker) and the
sadhana. The fourth point is to check up that you are not
disqualified for this sadhana. When people come into the field of
sadhana without having a proper understanding of these matters,
the sadhana does not create any sanskaras in their lives.
Examine yourself and see whether you feel happy when your
desire is fulfilled, or whether you feel happy when it is removed.
Observe this in your day to day life. If you derive rasa (deep
enjoyment) in the fulfillment of your desires, how can you obtain
rasa in their removal?
Give some thought to this. Suppose I am very fond of my watch. I
don’t want anyone to steal it; I want it to remain with me. Then, I
sit down to do dhyaana (meditation), with my eyes closed. I want
my mind to be focused. I open my eyes to check that the watch is
safe, and shut them again, to concentrate on the object of my
meditation. My mind fluctuates between the watch outside, and
the object of meditation that is inside.
If you love some external object and want your mind to
concentrate on an internal object, your mind will keep shifting
from one to the other repeatedly. You will have to bring it back
forcibly to the object your meditation each time. This is not the
fault of the Mahatma who tells you to meditate. Nor is it the fault
of the sadhana he had told you to do. The thing is that you
forcibly bring your mind to one place, but it keeps slipping back
to the objects of its own inclination. As long as external objects
attract you, how can you expect your mind to remain steady on
the inner object of meditation?
There is a gentleman who has been coming regularly to Satsang
for some fifteen or twenty years. One day somebody told him, ‘I
will make you do dhyaana (meditation) in three minutes.’ When
he went to the new Mahatma, he was told, ‘You have come for the
92

---

## Page 93

first time, for doing dhyana. You should at least have brought an
inexpensive garland to show your shraddhaa (faith)! You have
come empty handed.’
Nothing more was said that day. The following day the man went
again, taking a garland. The Mahatma gave him a mantra, and told
him to do japa (ritual chanting). ‘You will be able to do dhyana
when you do the japa of this mantra.’
‘I have been doing japa since many years. Why are you giving me
another mantra?’
‘Have faith in the mantra I have given,’ said the Mahatma. ‘You
mind will become focused if you chant this.’
‘You had told me that you would make me do dhyana in three
minutes.’
‘No, my brother. First do japa of the mantra I have given you, and
then come to me. I will make you do dhyana. It will take only
three minutes, but first you have to do this japa.’
On one occasion, there was rioting at Muradabad. One lakh
people gathered to do dhyana in three minutes. The police came
and dispersed the crowd. Instead of getting dhyana in three
minutes, they were beaten with batons! What I mean to say is that
you should not evaluate only the object or the action. You should
also evaluate your own capacity and eligibility.
I want to draw your attention to the method of the sadhana of the
Gita. No book can purify your antahkaran if you try to cleanse it
with the pages of the book. Someone told a Fakir, ‘Please let me
instantly get the Gnan contained in this book.’
‘Put a match to the book,’ said the Fakir. ‘Mix the ashes in a glass
of water and drink it!’ Gnan is not in the pages of a book. Every
pravachan (discourse), every book, and every preacher gives you
a degree of understanding. If you absorb the teaching and
inculcate it into your life, you will be liberated. No action can give
salvation to anyone.
What is the fruit of actions? You know that every action leads to
the development of your intellect. Everything you do causes a
fresh mental inclination that enhances the aham (ego). This is
93

## Page 94

called the fala (fruit) of the action. The fruit of a Yagya is not an
apsaraa (celestial nymph). The fruit of a Yagya is a feeling of
sukha (absolute comfort). All actions give a fruit in the
antahkaran. When learned people understand this, they learn the
technique of creating sukha. They create sukha through karmas,
through worship, and through Yoga. They create sukha even when
they give up all three, because they know the secret of creating
sukha.
Come; I will tell you how the Gita purifies your antahkaran. This
is an art that has to be learnt. It is not enough to go home saying
that you have just heard an excellent discourse. I will tell you one
of its characteristics. If someone were to recommend the same
medicine as a cure for all diseases, would you consider him to be
an expert? The man has become hypnotized by listening to praises
of this medicine. When people talk about any one medicine that
can cure all health problems, it is talk of faith and miraculous
cures.
It is the same in sadhana. No one method can be right for all
sadhaks. People indulge in immoral and unethical activities. They
need to make the proper effort to purify their mind. When the
fault lies in the karma, karma is needed to obliterate it. Now see
what the faults are, in the viewpoint of the Gita.
Our antahkaran has four parts. Some faults lie in the buddhi
(intellect) and some in the mana (mind). Now, think about what
karmas should be done to remove the doshas (faults) of each. The
desire in the antahkaran is one fault in sadhana. Our lack of
knowledge about our goal is the second fault. Avarice for
different objects is the third fault, and the restlessness of our mind
that cannot remain steady on the object of meditation is the fourth
fault. Now, if you have one cure for all these faults, it is very
good! May the Ishwara Grace you, that this magical method
improves your life.
In earlier times, it was the tradition that a Vaidya (Doctor of Ayur
Veda) would first of all see which kind of physical make up the
patient has. There are three types – pitta (bile), cough and vaata
94

## Page 95

(wind). Then he would decide which treatment was best suited for
the man’s prakriti (natural physical type). Even the purgatives
were different for the different types. These days, modern science
has a common purgative for all.
The search for spirituality is quite different. When karma is
attached to desires, it becomes impure. The science of spirituality
does not tell anyone to stop working. It diverts the direction of
desires, improves their quality, and then shatters them. When you
work to earn wealth, get married, or attain a high position, these
are areas of worldly achievements. However, in the area of
spiritual achievement, worldly goals are replaced by a desire for
lofty realms after death, for something out of this world, or for a
desire to be nishkaama (free of desire).
Imagine that a man wants to run a gambling den. If he gives up
this desire and applies himself to making a yagya-shaalaa (a place
for doing Yagyas), won’t his area of work be greatly improved? If
you were to tell him to sit quietly for a while, he may listen to
you, but he will resume his activities when he gets up again.
However, if you persuade him to divert his energies to another,
better goal, he will give up the bad activity in favor of a good one.
People do work to get bhoga (worldly pleasures). If you convince
them that they will get much exquisite bhoga in Swarga if they
practice some restraints and do some rituals, it will help them to
lead better lives.
Thus, there are two kinds of sakaama karma (actions for the
fulfillment of desires). One is the self-chosen effort for worldly
goals and the other is fulfilling desires through the methods
recommended by the Shastras. The second is called Dharma.
When a person fulfills his desires through forbidden acts, it is the
path of adharma (that, which is contrary to Dharma). This is the
path that leads to an impure antahkaran. When a person fulfills his
desire in keeping with Dharma, it purifies his antahkaran. All your
actions and indulgences should be within the framework of the
Shastras. There is a method in this.
95

## Page 96

The fact is that vaasanaa (avid desire; lust) is the impurity in
karma; and vasana is always for obtaining sukha in this world and
in Swarga. The Gita’s Karmayoga is very special. The Gita does
not draw your attention to the sukha you can get in this world or
in the next. The Gita says, ‘You will get these sukhas at the proper
time in any case, but try to remove the kaamanaa (desire) that is
at the root of your karmas.’ Now, kamana is not a servant who
you can dismiss at will. Desires will not cease to come into your
mind. To stop them, you need to use the right method. ‘Whatever
you do, ‘says the Gita, ‘don’t let your personal desires be the
primary factor. Let duty be the primary factor in all you do.’
The first point is, ‘I want to do my duty.’ The second point is,
‘This work is a worship of the Ishwara.’ And, ‘I will sit in peace
when I finish my task,’ is the third viewpoint.
In other words, work done as a duty, work done as worship, and
work done to obtain peace. Don’t let yourself get confused by all
the books. Observe the state of your mind when you have
completed some work. If you feel dissipated and want to go to
sleep, it indicates that you have done something shameful and
tamogunee (filled with the Tamo guna that contains sloth and
delusion). If you feel that the work brought great pleasure and you
want to indulge again, it indicates that what you did was
rajogunee (filled with Rajo guna, the tendency that causes desire
and activity). If your work gives you a feeling of peaceful
satisfaction, it would be saattvik (filled with Sattva guna, the
tendency that causes wisdom and tranquility) work.
Rajo guna has the effect of wanting pleasure repeatedly. It is filled
with hectic activity. Tamo guna has the effect of regret and
fatigue. It is filled with sloth and delusion. Therefore, to improve
the quality of your desires and purify the work you so, is the
method of sadhana.
I tell you this clearly – it is a different matter to work with a desire
for Swarga, and another thing altogether to work for purifying
your antahkaran. The fruit of Swarga is a loan, whereas the sukha
of nishkaamataa (being free of desires) is hard cash. One angle of
96

---

## Page 97

working as a sadhana is that our antahkaran is no longer sullied by
desires, and so it becomes pure. Another viewpoint is to do your
work as a duty. The third is to work as worship, and the fourth is
to do your work while remaining detached from its fruit.
Now see one more method of purification. This is a test of karma.
When a man sits absolutely unmoving, he thinks he is not
working. However, the Gita does not accept this. The Gita says
that you are free of work even while working, if you work for the
sake of doing your duty, with no desire for the fruit, as worship, or
with the feeling of being unattached. Such karma is akarma
(absence of karma). Even if you tie up your limbs and remain
unmoving, it is a deliberate karma to keep your limbs bound and
refrain from activity. Sitting with your back straight is karma, and
closing your eyes is also a karma.
‘Karmanyakarma yah pashye`d akarmani cha karma yah.’ This is
the Gita’s apoorvataa – her incomparable excellence. It says that
you are the form of akarma itself, even when you are doing the
work. But, you are working when you sit idle in a deliberate
attempt to pretend to not work.
Karmanyakarma yah pashye`dakarmani cha karma yah,
sa buddhimaanmanushe`shu sa yuktah kritsnakarmakrit.
(4. 18)
(The person who sees akarma in karma, and karma in akarma is
buddhimaana [wise]. He is a Yogi who does all the karmas.)
He is a ‘buddhimaana’ means that he is a Gnani. Sa yuktah means
that he is a Yogi; and sakritsnakarmakrit means that he is a
Karmayogi, because everything he does is done as a worship. That
means, he has Karmayoga, Gnanyoga, and Ashtanga Yoga (Yoga
in eight steps). When does he have all three? It is when he remains
detached from the fruit of the work, and has no feeling of being
the doer. This is the method given by the Gita for purifying our
work and our antahkaran. You should listen to the discourses and
pay attention to the method of working, to purify your antahkaran.
97

‘Bhaagah bhaktih’. Bhakti means to apportion, to separate; to
allocate the share. This portion belongs to A and this portion
belongs to B. For example, this is a watch. If I cannot see it
clearly, I put on my spectacles and with their help, I am able to
see the watch clearly. In the same way, when you want to see the
Ishwara, you have to put on the spectacles of shraddhaa (faith).
Then your intellect can give you a glimpse of that Ishwara who is
not a part of our visible world.
However, when you want to see the Atma, neither the specs used
for reading, nor the specs of shraddha are of any help. That being
the case, you must remove both these specs and use vive`k
(discrimination). Then your drishti (vision) begins to experience
and become aware of the Paramatma; to see Him and feel His
presence. In seeing the unseen Ishwara, the specs of faith are
needed. To see the material objects, gross specs are needed. But,
you can only have the experience of that, which is within and
cannot be seen or experienced by any other method by using of
discrimination of Gnan.
What is your goal? You have not yet seen your goal. Had you
seen it, you would have attained it, and it would no longer be
called a goal. A goal remains a goal as long as it is unattained.
So, to obtain that goal people have to make divisions. You have to
separate the anaatmaa – that, which is not the Atma – from the
Atma, to obtain the knowledge of the Atma. To obtain Gnan about
the Ishwara you have to give up the pratyaksha (gross matter that
can be experienced through the senses), and do bhakti of the
paroksha (unseen) Ishwara. Vivek is needed for the Atma and
bhakti is needed for the Paramatma. The Atma can only be
experienced, never seen. That is why it is necessary to
discriminate between the Atma and the anatma. Shraddha in the
Parameshwara is needed to have bhakti.
At a deeper level, where my ‘I’ is, is darshan and vivek. And,
what is at an even deeper level is That, where there is shraddha
and bhakti. What bhakti does is to bring clearly before us the form
that is firmly fixed as our goal. He is the Creator of space, time,
98

---

## Page 99

and matter. He is the drashtaa (the one who sees) of space, time
and matter. He is the Master of space, time and matter and also
their destroyer. He is all-knowing, He abides in all hearts, He is
the sarve`shwara – the Ishwara of all. This is how bhakti reveals
to us the pristine object we want to attain. Bhakti is a brilliant gem
that dispels the darkness of ignorance that prevents us from
knowing our goal. It also destroys the desires that sully our heart.
This is Karmayoga. Now, what does karma do? The purpose of
Yoga is to enable us to fix our mind steadily on our goal. Sadhana
is an earnest effort for spiritual progress; it is not a joke.
I had heard about a method of sadhana used by a Tantrik. You are
not familiar with all the different kinds of sadhanas. I had learnt
about the methods of over a hundred Sects. Don’t consider this to
be anything to admire – I am not telling you about it in
appreciation, but there is a Sect that believes that the impetus of
desire dies down immediately after copulation, so if a person does
dhyana at that time, he finds it easy to meditate.
Well! Won’t desire come again? Lust will definitely return to
bother him. I am telling you this deliberately, so that you don’t get
influenced by the current talk of license in sadhana. You take off
your shoes before going into a temple, but when you come out,
you wear the same shoes, no matter how dirty or tattered they are.
If you are engrossed in sensual pleasures and unethical habits, and
go into meditation for a while, it is just like taking off your shoes
for a while, when you go to the temple. All your wrong urges will
come back when the dhyana is over. Karmayoga is that, which
weakens your desires, and Bhaktiyoga is that, which enables the
mind to become focused.
Yogee yunjeeta satatamaatmaanam rahasi sthitah.
(6. 10)
(A Yogi should have no expectations and no possessions.)
E`kaakee yatachittaatmaa niraasheeraparigrahah.
(6. 10)
99

## Page 100

He should sit down and meditate.
Have you ever given thought to the word e`kaakee (alone)? A
Guruji told his disciple, ‘I am sitting in solitude to do dhyana. You
sit outside. Bring me a glass of water at five o’clock. Bring me a
cup of tea at six o’clock. By seven it will get quite warm, so come
in and fan me as I meditate.’ How is this ekaki? Sometimes,
people sit to do puja and become a nuisance to others in their
family. ‘I am sitting for puja, and you aren’t even helping me!’
My brother, to impose upon others is not the way to do puja. What
you are doing is forcing others to do your puja!
‘Yatachittaatmaa.’ What is this? You slap a mosquito that bites
you. You lick your lips when they get dry. All this indicates how
restless your mind is. Protect yourself from the flies and
mosquitoes of mental restlessness.
You plan to go to your shop after doing dhyana. Where are you
niraashee (without expectations)? ‘I am in a bit of a hurry,
Maharaj. I want to obtain the Ishwara today.’ People come to me
with an ultimatum – they must get Bhagwan’s darshan instantly,
or within three months.
And after that?
‘Then I will work for worldly goals.’
A servant told his master. ‘Master, give me a raise, or else…….’
‘Or else, what?’
‘Or else I’ll start drinking!’
Is the Ishwara all that desperate to give you His darshan? You
should be free of all expectations when you do bhajan (meditate
lovingly). How foolish it is to say that the Ishwara should reveal
himself because you want to go to your shop at ten o’clock!
Now, aparigraha (non-accumulation) comes after e’kaakee,
yatachittaatmaa and nirashee. ‘I don’t accept any money form
others, but it is true that when I sit for dhyana I keep some
refreshments beside me. I keep a glass of milk, some sweetmeats
and something savory, incase I feel like munching something.’
This is parigraha (accumulation). This is not how bhajan should
100

---

## Page 101

be done. The focus of our mind should either be our essence, or
the essence of the Parameshwara.
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t.
(6. 25)
(A sadhak should establish his mind in the Paramatma and think
of nothing else.)
The Gita tells you not to let your mind wander to anything that is
outside your body. ‘Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa.’ Fix your
mind upon your goal, your Atma, and give up thinking about
anything else. ‘Na kinchadapi chintaye`t. Now, see what comes to
you.
Prashaantamanasam hye`nam yoginam sukhamuttamam,
upaiti shaantarajasm brahmabhootamakalmasham.
Yunjanne`vam sadaatmaanam yogee vigatakalmashah,
sukhe`na brahma sansparshamatyantam sukhamashnute`.
(6. 27-28)
(A Yogi whose mind is at peace, who is free of sin and has no
restless tendencies, identifies with the Brahman. The Brahman is
pure existence, pure consciousness, and pure bliss. The Yogi
obtains pure bliss.
The Atma of such a Yogi is constantly united with the Paramatma.
He obtains the infinite bliss that is obtained only when a person
obtains the Parabrahm Paramatma.)
Shantim nirvaanaparamaam matsansthaamadhigachhati.
(6. 15)
(Such a Yogi obtains supreme peace.)
Thus, what has happened is that Bhaktiyoga eliminated the
portion of desire from the antahkaran, and removed the ignorance
about the goal. Yoga successfully curtailed the fluctuating mental
inclinations. However, the fourth dosha – delusion – had been
101

---

## Page 102

established in the mind. Is this the real Satya? Is it indeed the
Supreme Achievement? Is it the Supreme or not? A Yogi needs to
take the support of Gnan to remove these doubts.
‘Na hi gnaane`na sadrisham pavitramiha vidyate`.
(4. 38)
(There is no doubt that there is nothing in this world like Gnan,
for making the antahkaran pure.)

(The peak of Gnanyoga is the state of being able to work without
having any expectations.)

Bhaktyaa maamabhijaanaati yaavaanyashchaasmi tattvatah,
tato maam tattvato gyaatvaa vishate` tadanantaram.
(18. 51 – 55)
(The intellect of such a Yogi is pure. His intake is light, limited,
and Sattvik. He does not speak unless absolutely necessary. He
lives alone in a place that is naturally pure. His antahkaran is
purified with Sattvik thoughts. His senses, mind, speech, and body
are under his control. His raga-dvesh is completely eliminated. He
takes refuge in total renunciation. He gives up all arrogance,
power, vanity, desire, anger, and accumulation. He is always
inclined towards Dhyanayoga. He has no attachments, and is
always filled with peace. Such a Yogi is eligible for merging into
the Sacchidananda Brahman.
102

---

## Page 103

Then this Yogi – who has merged into the Sacchidananda
Brahman – has no cause for grief. There is nothing he desires. He
sees all as equal, and has goodwill for all. Such a Yogi obtains My
paraa-bhakti – the highest bhakti. Through this para bhakti he
obtains the knowledge of My essence. He knows what I am, as I
am. He merges into Me as soon as he obtains this knowledge.)
This is called Gnan. This Advaita-bodha (the knowledge that the
Brahman is non-dual and the substratum of everything) is the
ultimate object. There are thus four states. The removal of desire
through Karmayoga, the Gnan of the Paramatma through
Bhaktiyoga, a focused mind through Ashtanga Yoga, and the
knowledge of the non-dual Brahman through Advaita Gnan. This
is how the Gita cleanses the fourfold antahkaran. The buddhi is
one, but it had four forms which are cleansed by these methods.
Karmayoga, Bhaktiyoga, and Ashtanga Yoga are all forms of
Buddhiyoga. Even Tattvagnan (the knowledge of the essence of
the Brahman) is a form of Buddhiyoga.
Dadaami buddhiyogam tam ye`na maamupayaanti te`.
(10. 10)
(I give them the Buddhiyoga that enables them to obtain Me.)
One person says the Gita is anaasakti yoga (detaching ourselves
from everything except the Ishwara). Another calls it Karmayoga
or Gnanyoga. However, the Gita is only Buddhiyoga. What is
there that cannot be attained through buddhi? Buddhi is praised
throughout the Gita.
However, the Gita advocates neither using buddhi to make a
living, nor to create a controversy. It advocates using the buddhi
to attach ourselves to Bhagwan through all we do and feel.
‘Buddhiyogamupaashritya – take refuge in Budhdiyoga.’
‘Dadaamibuddhiyogam tam ye`na maamupayaanti te` - I gave
them the Buddhiyoga through which they obtain Me.’ In my
103

---

## Page 104

opinion, there can be no Yoga – except Budhdiyoga – in times to
come.
The eyes are kept closed in Ashtanga Yoga. Hands and legs are
used in Yoga to pray to the Devta. There is Yoga of silence for
stipulated periods. All these had their uses in different ages. This
is the age of Buddhiyoga, and the Gita gives us the teaching of
Buddhiyoga.

Pravachan VIII
The sanskaras of Dharma, bhakti and Gnan make life pure.
The Gita contains the distilled essence of the Upanishads. Who
brought out this Gnan? It was Shri Krishna. For whom? For
Arjuna. The Gita establishes the truth of what the Upanishads
state. It enhances the prestige of the Vedas.
The Gita does the sanskara of our life. I have already explained
what sanskara means. It means to wash the dirt off our body,
make the body smooth, and implant what is lacking in it. One is
the removal of dosha (faults), and durguna (bad tendencies). The
second is inculcating good tendencies like shama-dama (mental
and physical restraints). And the third is to obtain the Tattvagnan
(knowledge of the essence of the non-dual Brahman), that is
lacking.
A gentleman told me yesterday, ‘For years I have strived to get rid
of my bad tendencies, but they keep cropping up. Sometimes, it
seems that the habits developed early in life will never change.’
You see, a human being carries a certain temperament with him
when he is born. It is quite true that the banyan tree has its own
nature, grapes have their own nature and a bitter gourd has its own
nature. Everything has its own nature that is inherent in its seed.
However, it is possible to bring about considerable changes
through cultivation, fertilizers, grafting, etc.
A friend of mine planted a mango seed. He would water it with
milk. He was wealthy enough to afford this experiment. This was
some thirty or forty years ago. For ten years he watered the
sapling with milk. The mangoes that grew on that tree had the
flavor of milk. The seed was from an ordinary mango tree, but the
flavor was unique, because of the nourishment it got. He would
send me some mangoes from every crop. I have eaten them.
That means, if we bring some disciplines into our life – if we
nourish it, water it, and inculcate good habits – it is possible to
bring changes into the smell and taste of our body, in its
105

---

## Page 106

appearance, sensitivity and speech. The feeling of being a failure
that overcomes a sadhak occasionally is not proper. A sadhak
should always feel, ‘Kaarayam saadhayaami shareeram vaa
paatayaami – I will develop my life according to my goal, or
perish in the attempt.’ The feeling of losing hope is a weakness of
the mind. This is exactly what the Gita teaches.
Klaivyam maa sma gamah paartha naitattvamupapadyate`,
kshudram hradayadaurbalyam tyaktvottishtha parantapa.
(2. 3)
(Therefore, O Arjuna, do not allow yourself to be cowardly. This
is not right for you. You are the one who inflicts pain on his
enemies. Get rid of your faint-heartedness. Stand up and fight.)
Don’t form the impression that it is your nature to be faint-
hearted. What I want to tell you is to grit your teeth, clench your
fists, and do sadhana with determination. You will obtain success.
Now, another point. One gentleman is of the opinion that a
mantra, yantra (talisman) and sadhana should be such that they are
free of rules and restrictions. See the psychology of a person who
wants this. It is someone who does not like any form of discipline,
who prefers a license for misbehavior and indiscipline. I tell you
this mantra –
Hare` raama hare` raama raama raama hare` hare`,
Hare` krishna hare` krishna krishna krishna hare` hare`.
This mantra is from the Kalisantaran Upanishad. A question is
raised there – kosya vidhinishe`dhah (what is permitted and what
is forbidden)? The answer given is – naasya vidhinishe`dhah
(There are no rules about what is permitted and what s forbidden,
in context to this mantra.) When someone hears this and chooses
this mantra it indicates his preference to avoid rules and
regulations. His choice reveals his aversion for restrictions.
106

---

## Page 107

Similarly, there is a mantra – ‘sve`chhaachaaro vidhismritah’ – an
undisciplined life is the rule. ‘This is what I like!’. This shows an
inclination for profligacy. When a person hears that he is free to
do the japa (ritual chanting) of this mantra without submitting to
any restrictions regarding his food or lifestyle; that the mantra will
be successful without his needing to do anything else, it shows his
reluctance to change himself in any way.
Very well; if that be the case, why did the Shastras and Sadgurus
(enlightened Gurus) say this? There is a reason. Every human
being makes some mistakes, has some lapses, somewhere. The
purpose of giving this assurance is to make sure that the person
does not give up the mantra and the ritual when he slips up and
feels ashamed. It is not a matter of deliberately doing something
wrong. The intention is that if some lapse does occur, the person
feels that it will be removed by the mantra, by that sadhana. He
does not need to do a separate praayashchitta (penance) for his
lapse. Thus, the statements made to lay stress on the greatness of
the mantra are not legislatures. They are made to strengthen faith
in the mantra. The purpose is to induce people to use these
mantras (rather than shy away from sadhana because of their
unwillingness to change). People should not get mislead into
believing that they are free to do wrong things if they chant this
mantra.
I will now tell you the Gita’s message. A sadhak needs to have the
combined zeal of a businessman, the eagerness of a sensual man
who plans pleasures, and the faith of a Dharmik man who does
rituals like Yagyas. When your effort has all these, your sadhana
becomes a lagan (devotion).
The desire for sensual pleasures turns into pre`ma-bhakti. The
rules and restrictions of rituals turn into alertness to be free of
doshas. The effort for material wealth is used for the sadhana. Our
longing for Bhagwan should be like a lover’s longing for the
beloved. We have to become as uninterested in this world as a
Yogi. Only then does the mind get attached to the Paramatma.
107

## Page 108

I will tell you anther thing. In some places, the Shastras say that it
is very easy to obtain the Parameshwara, and in other places they
state that it is very difficult to obtain Him. If you study the Gita
you will find three viewpoints.
Avyaktaa hi gatirdukham de`havadbhiravaapyate`.
(12. 5)
(It is very difficult for a person who identifies with his body to
obtain the unmanifested Brahman.)
As long as the identification with the body remains, it is extremely
difficult for a person to progress towards the unmanifested
Brahman.
In another place you see –
Sukhe`na brahmasansparshamatyantam sukhamashnute`.
(6. 28)
(A Yogi who is free of sin easily experiences the infinite bliss of
the Parabrahm Paramatma.)
Sukhe`na – without facing hardship.
Pratyakshaavagamam dharmyam susukham kartumavyayam.
(9. 2)
(This Gnan is fruitful; it is in keeping with Dharma, easy to work
towards, and is everlasting.)
This path is pleasant in every way.
In this world there are two types of people. One type feel
discouraged at the thought of attempting to do anything that is not
easy. ‘Who will attempt such a difficult sadhana? And that, too,
for an Ishwara we cannot see and may not obtain?’ For such
people, it becomes necessary to say that it is easy to obtain the
Ishwara, else they will lose heart before they start!
Then, there are people who disdain anything that is easily
available and inexpensive. I heard about a lady who went to a
108

---

## Page 109

shop in London. She was shown identical dresses in different
packing. The dress in the fancy box was more expensive, but she
chose that, because she felt it was beneath her status to choose the
cheaper! Thus, some people choose the things that entail great
effort and expenditure. This is why the Shastras make the
conflicting statements about the Ishwara being easy and difficult
to obtain. The purpose is to motivate both kinds of people to do
sadhana.
Api pushpaavadalanaad api lochanameelanaat.
To obtain the Ishwara is easier than crushing a flower or closing
your eyes. He is not far away; He is here, now, and is our own
Self. What hardship is there in obtaining Him? So, it is for the
purpose of encouraging everybody to do sadhana that the Shastras
make statements that seem contradictory. The talk about being
free of restrictions is motivated by a desire to save people from
losing heart because of their weaknesses.
Another thing that is said is that a person’s life improves after
doing dhyana. That means, we first begin to improve our character
and food habits, we remove other faults and wrong tendencies.
People who don’t succeed in this, say, ‘Let us do dhyana and get
Gnan.’ As though dhyana and Gnan were so easy to obtain!
People don’t change their external habits, yet they think that they
can change their mind, succeed in meditation, and become
enlightened!
This is acceptable from the viewpoint that vive`ka (discrimination)
is being awoken in the person’s life. At least he has begun to
understand that it is good to meditate and obtain Gnan. Those who
say that all the sadguna (good tendencies) will come out of the
Atma are actually sagunavaadee (people who believe in the
Ishwara with attributes). In their opinion, when someone starts
doing dhyana and gets the knowledge of his own essence, then the
good tendencies will automatically emerge. However, they do not
109

---

## Page 110

know the principle of the nirguna (the Brahman without
attributes).
The fact is that in the opinion of the Jains, the Atma is an
effulgent pristine form. It is a karta before sadhana is done. You
would, perhaps, have noticed that when you sit for an hour,
focusing on the feeling that you are the saakshee (uninvolved
witness), and this feeling is also a play of your being the karta.
Those who believe in the nirguna are aware of this. They know
that the feeling was created through a conscious effort. You held
on to the feeling for an hour or so, and let it go. The feeling was
evoked, held on to, and given up. The feeling came from the
kartaapana (the feeling of being the doer), and it was given up by
the karta (doer).
There are many paths of sadhana, and none can be disqualified.
However, one should be aware of the faulty understanding of
these paths. What I want to tell you is that the Gita never wants
you to have dosha-durguna (faults and bad tendencies). The Gita
wants you to be pure and bright. The Gita wants your life to shine
in such a way that people who knew you earlier exclaim, ‘Oh, he
has become a Mahatma!’ People who considered you to be full of
faults will see the changes in your lifestyle and look up to you.
However, if a person becomes a gnaanee (one who has Gnan) and
a dhyaanee (one who does dhyana) and does not give up the
impurities that sully his life –
Buddhvaadvaitasvatattvasya yathe`shtaacharanam yadi,
shunaam tattvadrishaam chaiva ko bhe`doshuchibhakshane`.
(Panchadashi 4. 55)
If a person continues to indulge in immoral activities even after
obtaining Gnan and doing dhyana, what difference would there be
between his life and a dog’s life? If a Gnani and a dog both eat
impure food, what is the difference between them?
The meaning of the path of aadhyaatma (spirituality) is that just
as you want your home, body, and clothes to be clean, you should
also want your mind to be pure and bright. A life of spirituality is
110

---

## Page 111

a symbol of purity and effulgence. An adhyatmik life is not a life
to be lived in the seventh Heaven. It means a life of indulgences
that are pure, actions that are pure, feelings that are pure. It means
purity in speech, thoughts, and knowledge.
This adhyatmik life has come to wash away all desires from your
life. It has not come to allow you to remain as you are, throw you
into dirt, or let you indulge in immoral and unethical behavior. So,
you should not worry that not everyone comes into this life.
It may happen that you visit some forest or hilly tribes. You see
their little huts, clothes and lifestyle and want to bring
improvements into their lives. You want external improvements in
their living conditions, but – especially with regard to your inner
self – the things that fill your own mind are so dirty!
Trividham naraksye`dam dvaaram naashanamaatmanah,
kaamah krodhastathaa lobhastasmaade`tatryam tyaje`t.
(16. 21)
(The three gateways to naraka [Hell] are kaama, krodha, lobha
[desire, anger, greed]. They destroy the Atma, meaning, they take
a person to Hell, so they should be given up.)
The spiritual life teaches you to be pure. Desire, anger and greed
are the doorways to your downfall. They sully the Atma – tasmaat
e`tatrayam tyaje`t – give up all three.
E`tairvimuktah kaunte`ya tamodvaaraistribhirnarah,
aachaaratyaatmanah shre`yastato yaati paraam gatim.
(16. 22)
(A person who is free of these three gateways to Hell behaves in a
way that brings liberation. He attains the supreme state. That is, he
obtains Me.)
‘E`tairvimuktah kaunte`ya - be free of them, and walk on this
path. Do the sadhana that will liberate you.’ Our Swamiji,
Yoganandji Maharaj, used to say, ‘Look, my brother, until now,
111

---

## Page 112

you were alone. You did whatever you felt like. Now you have
become connected with me. Any wrong action of yours will result
in both of us being criticized. So keep your character pure – for
your sake as well as for my reputation.’
When a person goes to Satsang (spiritual discourses) and starts
doing some meditation, etc, his life represents all spiritual
aspirants. If he does something wrong, people will say, ‘Look at
these Satsangis!’ They will not name anybody. They will only
say, ‘He is a great Satsangi.’ Thus, the effort to purify our life
should never be given up. This is the message of Satsang, of
spirituality, of the Gita, and of the Upanishads.
If someone encourages you to bring impurities into your life, then
what have you achieved by going to Satsang? Impurities are all
around. The purpose of going to Satsang is to bring purity into
your life. The fact is that bhakti and Gnan manifest fully only
when the mind is pure. They do not emerge fully unless the mind
is free of impurities. So, understand this from the Gita –
Ve`daavinaashinam nityam ya e`namajamavyayam,
Katham sa purushah paartha kam dhaatayati hantikam.
(2. 21)
(O Arjuna, son of Pritha, when a person knows that the Atma is
immortal, eternal, unborn, and inexhaustible, how can he think of
being the cause of someone’s death, or of killing anyone?)
When a person has obtained the Gnan of his eternal, unborn
unchanging Atma, where is the question of his killing or getting
someone killed? The meaning of this is that his kartrittva (feeling
of being the doer) is no more, and therefore, he no longer suffers
from moha (delusion) or shoka (sorrow). When you read this, you
must also understand that this Gnan about the Atma can come
only to a person whose life is pure.
A man who lived in a joint family did a ritual worship to
propitiate a Devta. The Devta was pleased, and told the man to
ask for a boon. ‘Let me be the most long-lived person in the
112

---

## Page 113

family,’ he asked. From one viewpoint, this sounds like an
excellent boon, but what happened is that the man lived on to see
his sons and grandsons pass away. Every death brought its own
grief for him. ‘I made a great mistake by asking for a long life,’ he
told the Devta. ‘You gave me a long life, but that only increased
my sorrows. I have had to see my dear ones pass away one by
one.’
The Devta told him, ‘The only way to be free of grief is to be free
of moha-mamataa (delusion and attachment) for anyone. If you
have no attachment for anyone, you will not grieve for anyone.
Otherwise, you will be surrounded by sorrow and delusion.’
Ve`daavinaashinam nityam ya e`namajamavyayam.
This Atma of yours is indestructible. It is eternal and unborn.
What this means is that if, in spite of being the indestructible
unborn Atma, you get attached to mortal beings, you will have to
face sorrow every now and then. In life, there are so many things
that come and go. So many garments came to you and were
discarded; so many other possessions that seemed very attractive,
but they all wore out. You got comfortable houses, but shifted to
other homes. You got affectionate friends who are no longer with
you.
Your life is indestructible, while the things of this world are
transient. If you know this ve`daavinaashinam nityam – the
avinaashee (indestructible essence) described in the Gita, you
have recognized that the Atma cannot be destroyed. Then, you
should at least no longer feel shoka-moha (sorrow and delusion)
for that, which is destructible. Hence, what is desired is the
washing away of shoka and moha.
I have been telling you since the very first day that the purpose of
sanskaras is to blow away the faults of the antahkaran. It may be
faulty understanding, shoka-moha, raaga-dve`sha (attachment-
hatred), or an inclination for something improper. The purpose of
the Gita is to remove all these. If the Gita did not make our life
113

---

## Page 114

pure – if it allowed us to live like pigs – what was the need of the
Gnan given by the Gita?
Thus, the purport of the Shastras is the removal of the doshas of
our antahkaran. See what the Gita has to say about this. Every
point is beautifully clarified.
Take bhakti. One of our Seths does a lot of mantra-japa (ritual
chanting with a rosary). When he lends money, he may
occasionally forgo interest or charge something nominal, if it is
given to a wealthy man. However, he never fails to charge a hefty
interest when lending money to a poor man.
Now, when you want to spend money to do Dharma – build a
charitable hospital or school for the poor – why do you make poor
people pay such high rates of interest? You first cheat people and
make money by unethical means, and then you claim to use it for
charity? If you really want to do Dharma, why don’t you let it
remain with the poor man who needs it so badly? Why do you do
adharma (that, which is contrary to Dharma) to get hold of
money? If the money is procured through adhrama, will it create
Dharma? Dharma is not created by elaborate rituals, or worship,
or japa, or holding a feast for Brahmins. Dharma is created when
the heart is filled with benevolence. The Gita gives you a darshan
(vision) of a bhakta.
Anape`ksha shuchirdaksha udaaseeno gatavyathah,
Sarvaarambhaparityaagee yo madbhaktah sa me` priyah.
(12. 16)
(A bhakta who expects nothing, has internal and external purity,
has dexterity, is unbiased, free of sorrow and has no interest in
any new venture, is dear to Me.)
This is the outline of a bhakta. He is anape`ksha – free of
expectations; shuchih – his mind is nirmal (unsullied) and pavitra
(pure). Pavitra does not mean well-washed clothes, or hands
washed with clay. It does not mean wearing silk clothes or the
114

---

## Page 115

clothes worn in aparasa (when devotees maintain certain rituals
of purity).
Shauchaanaamapi sarve`shaam arthashaucham,
Yasthaarthe`h shuchirhi shuchih na mridvaari shuchih shuchih.
Manuji asked, ‘Who is shuchi (purity)?’ Of all the rules of
pavitrataa (purity), the most important is for wealth to be pure.
Earth and water do not make a man pure. A man whose wealth is
pavitra, is pavitra. How can wealth be pavitra? It is pavitra if it is
obtained through work that is pavitra, and comes to us by our
behavior being pavitra.
Anape`kshah shuchirdaksha udaaseeno gatavyathah.
This is the portrait of a bhakta, drawn by Bhagwan. Tell me, does
the Gita say anything about the color of a bhakta’s clothes?
Should a bhakta wear red, yellow, white, or blue clothes? I
challenge anyone to show me a single shloka, or half or quarter of
a shloka that mentions this.
Very well, which chandan (sandalwood paste) should be applied,
to be considered a bhakta? Should our chandan be horizontal or
vertical? Does the Gita have anything to say about this? Bhagwan
gives no such characteristics about His bhakta. He says, ‘Nirmala
mana jana so mohi paavaa.’ (A person whose heart is clean
obtains Me.)
Adve`shtaa sarvabhootaanaam maitrah karuna e`va cha,
Nirmamo nirahankaarah samadkhasukhah kshamee.
(12. 13)
(A person who feels no hatred for any creature, is not selfish, has
affection for all, and is naturally compassionate; a person who has
no partiality and no prejudice for any, is free of ego, forgiving,
and equally serene in joy and sorrow.)
115

---

## Page 116

See the portrait of His bhakta that Bhagwan has drawn. His bhakta
has no hatred for anyone. He wants the good of all beings, and is
compassionate towards all beings. He does not indulge in
favoritism.
Nirmamo nirahankaara (without partiality or arrogance). A
bhakta doesn’t feel partial even towards the people of his own
sect, community, family, religion, age group, or status. To have no
kind of favoritism, ego, or aversions are the characteristics of a
bhakta. This is the purity of the heart. When this bhakti comes
into your life, it makes you pure.
See how Yoga makes you nirmala (free of impurities). Yoga says,
‘I won’t let sorrow touch you.’ The biggest malinataa (impurity)
is the dukha (sorrow) that is the consequence of impurities. You
want to save yourself from sorrow. When Yoga comes into your
life, the sorrows you wish to avoid will leave you forever. What is
it that we call Yoga?
Tam vidyaad dukhasanyogaviyogam yogasangitam.
(6. 23)
(That, which has no association with the sorrowful world, and is
called Yoga, should be known.)
For example, this watch I have is protected in many ways. It will
not break if it falls. Nor will it get spoilt if it falls into a pool of
water. It is waterproof and shockproof. That is how it has been
made. Similarly, if you do sadhana, it will make you dukha-proof!
How?
‘Tam vidyaad dukha-sanyoga-viyogam’. Observe how the words
have been used. Dukha is not viyog (separation), it is ‘dukha-
sanyog-viyog’, meaning, it is like being unaffected by a blow. It is
like the watch remaining unaffected when it falls into a pool of
water. In the same way, the meaning of dukha-sanyog-viyog is
that you may fall into the sea of suffering, the flames of sorrow, or
the storms of anguish, but you will have no connection with
116

---

## Page 117

sorrow. This is what ‘dukha-proof’ means. It does not mean that
causes of sorrow will never come into your life.
Death appeared before a bhakta. He was lying on a cot, but he
picked up his kartaal (cymbals) and began to dance. ‘Bhagatji,
you seem very happy today,’ said someone.
‘For a long time I was separated from my Prabhu, my Beloved.
Today I will go to Him. What day can be happier than this, in my
life?’ replied the bhakta.
What is this dukha-sanyog-viyog? It is a sanskara. It is an inner
cleansing. It makes your antahkaran such that your mind remains
free of worldly sorrows. It slips away from the temporal to the
sublime.
A thief came into someone’s house. ‘Maharaj,’ the man told me,
‘I caught the thief, but he slipped out of my hands and escaped.’
‘You are a strong man,’ I said. ‘How did the thief escape your
hold?’
‘He had oiled his body and wore nothing but a loin cloth. His
body was so slippery that he was able to wriggle out from my
hands.’ So, at that point, the thief’s body had become capture-
proof! It is not that he was not caught. He was indeed captured,
but his well-oiled body slithered out of the hands that held him.
He was unaffected by the capture.
The paddy fields are muddy when the laborers go to cut the grass.
The men oil their bodies so thoroughly that the water does not
reach their skin. If you want to work in this sorrowful world, you
will have to anoint your heart; do such sanskaras that it is not
affected by sorrow. Unless you do this, you will laugh seventeen
times a day and weep seventeen times a day. How will your brain
function? A moody man is incapable of succeeding in anything in
life. You have to work with a firm resolve. A person’s real nature
is revealed when he faces adverse situations. Normally, he smiles
and looks affectionately at you. It is only when things go contrary
to his liking that he shows his true nature.
117

## Page 118

So, what Yoga means is that our antahkaran becomes such that it
remains unaffected by all external sorrows and setbacks. This is
called ‘Yoga.’
‘Tam vidyaad dukha-sanyoga-viyogam yoga-sangitam.’
How?
Sukhamaatyantikam yattadbuddhigraahyamateendriyam.
ve`tti yatra na chaivaayam sthitashchalati tattvatah.
(6. 21)
(The ultimate bliss is far beyond any sensual pleasure. It can be
experienced only by the subtle intellect that has been purified. The
Yogi who experiences this is established in the essence of the
Paramatma. He never slips from this state of pure bliss.)
You will obtain the aatyantika sukha – the ultimate happiness.
Atyantik sukha means the happiness that crosses all boundaries,
the sukha that has no end. That means, time cannot affect this
pristine happiness. You need not go anywhere to obtain it. The
union of senses and sense objects is not needed. Neither do your
senses need pleasurable experiences, nor does your mind need
novelty. Your happiness does not wane with time. It is always
with you wherever you are, regardless of the presence or absence
of physical comfort or pleasure. When your mind attains this state,
and sorrow can no longer mar your happiness, it is called aatma-
sanskaara – the sanskara of the Atma.
The sadhana we do, this practice, this Yoga, and the books on
spirituality – what they do, is to completely remove sorrow from
our life. And, a total removal of sorrow can take place only when
doshas are completely removed. Thus, the Gita’s purpose is to do
the sanskaras of our doshas and destroy them, to replace faults
with good tendencies, and to correct the faulty perceptions of the
intellect that is called viparyaya.
118

---

## Page 119

Understand what viparyay is. The essence of your Atma is sukha.
It is sukha that is always with you. Yet, look at the viparyay of the
buddhi – your intellect does not accept the essence of your Atma
as sukha. It believes that sukha comes and goes with some events,
objects, or people. This faulty perception is called viparyay of the
buddhi.
There is a woman. Her husband is with her, but she does not find
sukha in his presence. She funds faults, like his coming home late,
not bringing something she wanted, or neglecting to do some task.
‘Why didn’t you speak to me in this manner? Why didn’t you
look at me like that today?’ Yet, when friends come on a visit, she
feels that they brought happiness. This is her faulty thinking. She
doesn’t feel happy in her husband’s company; she finds happiness
in the company of his younger brother.
When the perception is faulty, people find sukha in what they
don’t have; not in what they have. They find sukha in the things
that are difficult to obtain, not in what is easily available. This is
called viparyay.
So, see what Vedanta says. It says that the light that lights up your
life is the Atma. The Atma-tattva (the essence of the Atma) is
what brings sukha into your intellect. That Atma-vastu (the thing
that is your Atma) is the indestructible Paramatma who never
leaves you. Your focus is not on the essence of the sukha that is
your Atma. You consider it to be of little value. You never pay
attention to it. Your attention is on the transient objects that come
and go. Your intellect is convinced that these are what give
happiness. They are just a flash of light.
You have seen so many being born and grow up. You have seen
them turn grey with age. But, you have not noticed the one who
saw them. We see how fast youth comes and goes. We find
happiness in visitors and guests, and the people we meet on the
road. We find that sukha lies in the wealth in other people’s
homes. My brother, you are also something! You never notice
what you are! This is viparyay.
119

---

## Page 120

What, then, is viparyay? It is faulty understanding. Faulty
perceptions cause much sorrow. The purpose of our adhyaatma
shaastra (the spiritual scriptures) is to remove faulty evaluations.
Value your Self. Look at your Self. The adhyatma Shastra does
the sanskara of four things. It purifies our actions, indulgences,
speech and accumulation. Bhakti comes with the sanskara of
purifying our desires, and Yoga brings the sanskara of quieting
our restless mind. All those who are unhappy in this world are
unhappy because they value others; not themselves. They are
unhappy because they have forgotten their Self. Vedanta and
Tattvagnan (knowledge of the essence of the Brahman) awaken
the awareness of the value of our Atma.
Naasato vidyate` bhaavo naabhaavo vidyate` satah,
ubhayorapi drishtontastvanayastattvadarshibhih.
(2. 16)
(That, which does not exist, has no reality, and the Sat – pure
existence – always exists. This is how the enlightened Saints have
always seen the essence of matter.)
What is not cannot be; and what is, cannot be destroyed. The
Atma can never be destroyed and that, which is transient, can
never be the ultimate reality. Mahatmas understand the secret
about both, and remain established in their own essence.

Pravachan IX
The method for removing the doshas of asmitaa (ego) – 1.
The Gita establishes a balanced shraddhaa (faith) and buddhi
(intellect). Many people talk only about shraddha, making the
buddhi secondary. Others emphasize on the buddhi, making
shraddha relatively unimportant. You know that the Gita gives the
greatest importance to the buddhi. Buddhi is needed for
Karmayoga (worship through work).
E`shaa te`bhihitaa saankhye` buddhiryoge` tvimaam shrunu.
(2. 39)
(O Arjuna! I gave you the explanation of buddhi regarding
Gnanyoga. Now, listen to the importance of buddhi for
Karmayoga.)
That means, neither Karmayoga nor Sankhyayoga are possible
without buddhi. Vive`ka-buddhi (the discriminating intellect) is
needed for both, because any action, worship, Yoga, or sadhana
needs to be done within the framework of what is appropriate.
Whether you want to go somewhere, do some work, say
something, eat or drink, it must be done in the right way. We have
to consider whether it is proper to look at the person we can see.
Vivek is needed even for this. Our literary friends state that
enjoyment is only possible if the method is right. All pleasure is
lost if the method is broken.
Now, look at the facts regarding shraddha. ‘Shraddhatsva
saumya! Ananubhooto na manah prashtumarhati. Do shraddha,
my child. Have faith. No object can touch the mind unless it has
been experienced.’ If something comes into the mind it is due to a
past experience, either in this lifetime or a previous one,
knowingly or unknowingly. Shraddatsva saumya. The shurti
(Vedic verse) says, ‘Saumya (gentle child), do shraddha.’
121

---

## Page 122

‘Shraddhayaa satyam aapyate`’ - Satya (the Truth) is obtained
through shraddha.
‘Shraddhaam praatarhavaamahe`’ – we invoke shraddha early
morning. Shraddha is essential even for obtaining Gnan.
‘Shraddhaavaan labhate` gnaanam (5. 39)’. Gnan is obtained by
those who have shraddha. You will observe that children tend to
imitate their seniors. A child will try to do what he sees his elders
do. He wants to follow the practices of his family, religious sect
and community.
People come to meet me. They tell their children to take prasaad
(sanctified food, given as a blessing) from me. The children feel
timid, but they come forward readily when they see the elders take
prasad. So, you should do the things you want your children to do.
When your child sees your actions, he develops shraddha that this
is the right thing to do, and does it. When he grows up, he will
develop vivek. He will give thought to what is proper and what is
improper, before doing anything.
I have told you earlier, that that, which does not enhance ethics
and culture in your life, is not a Shastra (scripture). A Shastra is
that, which does the sanskara of a human’s life, knowingly or
unknowingly, by seeing others or acting independently. The Gita
gives us the shraddha that enables us to achieve this, and also the
requisite buddhi. You will notice that there is one whole chapter –
the seventeenth chapter – in the Gita, devoted to the three kinds of
shraddha. It is called the ‘Shraddhaatrayavbhaaga yoga.’ You
may consider shraddha to be less important, but the Gita devotes
an entire chapter to explain the grades of shraddha. One is the
saatvikee shraddhaa (the faith of those who have the lofty
tendencies of Sattva guna). The other is the raajasee shraddhaa
(the faith of those who have the mixed tendencies of Rajo guna)
and the third is the taamasee shraddhaa (the faith of those who
have the lowly tendencies of Tamo guna).
The Bhagwat mentions a fourth kind of shraddha called the
nirguna shraddhaa. You can read the eleventh chapter of the
Bhagwat to know more about this. The worldly bonds of a person
122

---

## Page 123

are not broken completely even by Sattvik shraddha. The Rajasee
shraddha is definitely binding, and the Tamasee shraddha
strengthens worldly bonds further. The nirguna shraddha is that,
which loosens all worldly bonds. We see how the Gita lays stress
that Buddhiyoga (attaching the intellect to Bhagwan) is the
highest, and simultaneously emphasizes on the greatness of
shraddha. No other Yoga is praises as much in the Gita.
If you want you mind to be attached to the Paramatma,
Buddhiyogamupaashritya macchitah satatam bhava.
(18. 57)
(Let your intellect take refuge in Me; let your mind dwell on Me
continuously.)
You can attach your mind to the Paramatma only through Buddhi
Yoga. When you begin to understand the essence of the
Paramatma, and know His characteristics, you will see Him
everywhere. You will see Him in the sun and the moon. You will
see His presence in your life. You will see Him in the earth, water,
fire, and wind. When you take refuge in Buddhi Yoga, there is
nothing that does not seem to be a form of the Paramatma. If you
want to obtain Gnan –
Dadaami buddhiyogam tam ye`na maamupayaanti te`.
(10. 10)
(I give the Buddhi Yoga, the Yoga of Tattvagnan that makes My
bhakta capable of obtaining Me.)
Buddhi Yoga will give you Gnan, and you will obtain the
Paramatma. Buddhi Yoga for becoming emotionally attached to
the Paramatma, and Buddhi Yoga to obtain Him. How marvelous!
Buddhi Yoga is the method for breaking even the bonds created
by our own actions. ‘Karmajam buddhiyuktaa hi falam tyaktvaa
maneeshinah. (2. 5)’. (Gnanis, whose intellect has attained
equanimity, are liberated from the bonds of karma.) Buddhi Yoga
123

---

## Page 124

is also the method for removing any desire for the fruit of your
actions. Buddhi Yoga is needed if you are to avoid partisan
feelings or hatred caused by desires and attachments.
You see, six points about Buddhi Yoga should be kept in mind.
(1) Buddhi Yoga gives you the sanskara that nothing in this world
can induce you to any unjust action or oppress anyone, to obtain
what you want.
(2) A Buddhi Yogi (one who has Buddhi Yoga) is satisfied with
his own Self. He needs no other to be satisfied.
(3) A Buddhi Yogi never becomes nervous in times of trouble.
Nor does he confine his vision to hold on to sukha.
(4) Good times and bad times come periodically in life. A Buddhi
Yogi does not get so overcome with either that he forgets himself.
(5) A Buddhi Yogi has the capacity to withdraw into himself
whenever he wants. There is nothing in this world that he cannot
give up. This is the greatness of Buddhi Yoga.
(6) A Buddhi Yogi is one who has experienced the sweet flavor of
his own Atma. He is not attached to anything in this world.
The supreme greatness of Buddhi Yoga is thus described in the
Gita. You will see that vairaagya 9detachment) is obtained by
buddhi; so are Yoga and Samadhi.
Tadaa te` mohakalilam buddhirvyatitarishyati,
tadaa gantaasi nerve`dam shrotavyasya shrutasya cha.
Shrutivipratipanna te` yadaa sthaasyati nishchalaa,
samaadhaavachalaa buddhistadaa yogamavaapsyasi.
(2. 52-53)
(The moment your buddhi crosses over the quicksand of delusion,
you will become detached from all the sensual pleasures available
in this world and in the Heaven you have heard about.
The buddhi that is confused by the different things you have heard
will become steady, and attach itself to the Paramatma. You will
obtain Yoga; meaning, you will always be united with Me, the
Paramatma.)
124

## Page 125

Buddhi, for becoming free of desires; buddhi, for detachment;
buddhi, for being liberated from the bonds of karma; buddhi, for
being free of sorrow and delusion! The Gita comes into our life
with an extraordinarily great buddhi.
The root of sorrow has been divided into four parts. What is the
sorrow? It is when wealth is stolen. Loss of wealth is considered
to be a great sorrow in this world. The death of a dear one is a
great sorrow; as is an insult. However, the basic cause of all these
sorrows is that we have accepted this body made of bones, flesh
and skin, to be our ‘I’.
Even regarding the Ishwara – what is it that you want? I ask the
people who want the Ishwara to not take offence at what I say, but
– don’t you want the Ishwara to come and stand before these eyes
made of flesh and skin? That means, the center of Bhagwan’s
darshan is also these gross eyes. It is quite true that Bhagwan’s
darshan is obtained through these physical eyes, but I ask you to
give thought to where your ‘I’ is. Can’t Bhagwan give darshan on
a rubbish heap? He gives darshan even to a bhakta who has
entered the mouth of aghaasura (the Demon who personifies sin).
It is true that if a bhakta goes and sits on a garbage dump,
Bhagwan is so merciful that He will give His bhakta His darshan
even there. Nothing is impossible for Bhagwan.
Even so, you should also look at yourself and see where you are
calling Bhagwan to come and meet you. Are you asking Him to
come to a garbage dump, or to a public waiting room? Or are you
asking Him to come to a place where you meet your friends for
idle chitchat? Where is it that you want Bhagwan to come? Do
you have any quiet place that is private and clean, for Him to
come to? If not, why do you want His darshan (vision)? Why
don’t you want that your mind should become attached to Him?
Is it not that at the back of your mind lies the thought that if
Bhagwan once gives you His darshan and goes away, you will be
free to indulge in kaama (lust), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), and
moha (delusion)? You don’t care if people blame Bhagwan for
having such bhaktas. Why is it that you never want you mind to
125

get attached to Bhagwan forever? So, Narayana, observe what the
sorrows in your life are. Your sorrows are due to your identifying
with your body, and your attachment for those who are related to
it. You want to push your friends ahead and leave your foes
behind. Wherever the subtle ego of identification with the body is
present, sorrow will also be present.
I remember how sad I felt when I was young, and one person said
that I have enmity for him. I had gone to Balia. One man had
organized a festival, but I was not invited. So, the people with
whom I was staying started Satsang (spiritual discourses).
Gradually a few hundred people gathered for the discourses. The
man who had organized the festival began to tell people that I had
enmity for him and had come to Balia to spoil his festival! This
was despite the fact that I did not even know the man! When I
heard this, I went to his festival uninvited. I had no wish to spoil
his festival; I wished him well in every way.
So, when did I feel bad? It was when someone accused me of
having hatred or attachment. I will tell you about my dosha – the
fault that caused my sorrow. The other man was not to be blamed
for what he said. He only said what he felt. The fault was mine. I
was disappointed that he did not consider me to be a Mahatma; he
believed me to be capable of raaga-dve`sha (attachments-
aversions). The subtle ego – asmita – of being a Mahatma that
was imbedded in my mind was the cause of my sorrow. Not once,
but several times have I felt sad because of my asmita. Asmita is
the subtle desire for an individual identity. ‘Asme`ra bhaavah
asmitaa’ – being established as an individual is ‘asmitaa.’
So, the cause of our sorrow is our getting immersed in this body
and the things related to it. It means losing ourselves in our ego to
such an extent that we forget the viewpoint of humanity, of
mankind, of the Paramatma. What is the reason for our sorrow?
Somebody’s death is not the cause of our sorrow. The death is
outside and the sorrow is inside. The cause of dukha is where
dukha is. Fire is where the spark is. Dukha is there, where there
are raga-dvesha. Dukha is there, where there is asmita. Dukha is
126

there, where there is lack of wisdom. Quite often, someone says
something with great love, but we are not able to understand the
love and we get upset.
Now see this – remove your ‘I’ from your body. Use
dharmaadhyaasa (the superimposition of Dharma on your pristine
essence) to remove your de`haadhyaasa (the superimposition of
your body on your pristine essence, your ‘I’). One gentleman had
come to me. He said, ‘You tell us to do this first and do that first.
In my opinion, if we get Gnan, and the experience of the Ishwara,
all that you tell us to do will happen automatically.’ What he
meant was that the sadhans I had suggested were harder than
obtaining Gnan or the experience of the Ishwara! Such people say
that the Ishwara is experienced first – that is the sadhana; and
worldly goals are achieved after that – they are the fruit!
The fact is, we have to begin from where we are. Our sadhana
starts from our present position. The goal is not the sadhana. So,
then, where are you seated? In your de`ha (body), isn’t it? Sadhan
is needed to lift your ‘I’ up, out of your body. You existed before
you acquired this body, and you will exist even when this body is
no more; but at present, you are where your body is.
Dharma tells us that the body exists at this moment, but you will
exist even after it passes away. Dharma tells us that at present you
are in the form of a human body, but the end of this form will not
be your end. Dharma lifts your ‘I’ out of this physical form. It
does so unknowingly, without vive`ka (discrimination).
All right, raga-dvesha are pratyaksha dukha (sorrow that is
obvious and visible). We experience the sorrow caused by our
attachments and aversions. If you do not consider attachments and
aversions to be sorrow, you will feel no sorrow even if someone
cuts you into two. How sullied is the mind that is trapped in an
infatuation for someone, for whom your heart flutters like a caged
bird. You feel that you will die without him. You never realize
that your suffering is because you are trapped by this worldly
attachment.

Monkey trainers bury a narrow necked jar, with groundnuts in it.
The monkey comes to get the nuts, slips its hand inside the jar and
clutches the nuts. Its fist is too broad to be pulled out, and it
doesn’t want to let go of the nuts, so it gets caught. It is beaten,
tied, and made to dance. The fire of hatred burns in your heart, but
people don’t feel that they are suffering.
Today I want to tell you about asmita. Why are we dukhi (sad)?
Our sorrow stems from the fact that we consider our Self to be a
separate individual. We feel sorrow that another person doesn’t
consider us to be a great scholar, or a man of great renunciation.
We get upset if someone does not accept that we are in a peaceful
state of Samadhi. The peaceful state of Samadhi is also a state of
being separate; and being a Gnani is also a state of being separate.
I will tell you about myself. All kinds of things happen when we
are young and immature. Well, when I was young, I believed
myself to be a Gnani. I was absolutely certain that I had attained
Brahmagnan. I had gone to a Mahatma, and wanted him to talk to
me as to an enlightened Mahatma. Wasn’t that foolish of me? I
went and bowed down, and sat at his feet. I wanted to ask him
some questions. Why should he consider me a Brahmagnani? It
was merely my foolishness.
‘You should do nididhyaasana (withdraw the mind)’, he told me
with great love. He did not tell me to do shravana (listen to
spiritual discourses, the first step in the practice of Yoga). That
means, he did not express any doubts about my resolve for
spiritual progress. He did not tell me to do manan (reflect upon
the discourses, the second step in Yoga). He told me to do
nididhyasana (the third step). ‘He considers me to be a sadhaka,’ I
thought, ‘since he is telling me to do nididhyasana.’ Now, I know
that you are not likely to be troubled by such thoughts. All of you
are very wise; but I am telling you of my own lack of wisdom. I
felt that the Mahatma is telling me to do nididhyasana so that my
viparyay would be removed.

The shlokas of Panchadashi came to my mind instantly. Those
who don’t have Gnan should do shravan. But, I knew that I had no
need for shravan.
Shrinvantu agnaatatattvaaste` jaanan kasmaachhrinomyaham,
Manyantaam sanshayaapannaa na manye`ham asanshyah.
(Panchadashi 14. 47)
Those who have doubts and dilemmas should do manan. But, I
had none, and so had no need to do manan.
Viparyasto nididhyaase`t kim dhyaanam aviparyaye`,
De`haatmatva-viparyaasam na kadaachid bhajaamyaham.
(Panchadashi 14. 48)
People who have viparyay should do nididhyasana. I had no
viparyay, so why should I do dhyaana (meditation)? I never had
the viparyay of identifying with my body.
This was my immediate reaction.
When I recall my reaction to the Mahatma’s advice, I am amused
at my own foolishness. My reaction was not a characteristic of a
Brahmagnani! If someone believes that we are a jeevaatmaa (an
Atma attached to a body), a jigyaasu (seeker of the ultimate
Truth), or a saadhaka (spiritual seeker), and gives us advice – and
we at once claim to be a Brahmagnani, that is definitely not the
reaction of a Brahmagnani. It is the reaction of a person who has
asmita. This asmita is present in the minds of those who do a lot
of Satsang. It is much stronger in the minds of those who don’t do
Satsang. They are bound to have abhinive`sha (identify with their
body). They are immersed in the body made of bones, flesh and
skin; how can they ever get the subtle ego of a Samadhi done by a
separate individual?
Now, whatever kind of abhimaana (ego, vanity, pride) it may be,
all abhimana comes within the aasuree sampatti (the traits of
Demons).

Dambho darpobhimaanashcha krodhah paarushyame`va cha,
agnaanam chaabhijaatasya paartha sampadamaasureem.
(16. 4)
(O Partha, arrogance, conceit, and pride – as well as anger
callousness and ignorance – are the characteristics of a person
born with Demonic tendencies.)
The Asuri inclination of a person leads to pride. A subtle Buddhi
Yoga is needed to remove this asmita. Regarding this, give
thought to what you are. When you think about your Self, you will
see that your asmita will reduce.
Think about the Ishwara’s greatness, His magnificence! I am
telling you something practical – whenever the thought of your
good qualities comes to you, think about someone superior. If a
millionaire feels proud of his wealth, he should think about a
billionaire. The millionaires of our country look down on others,
but when they go to America and see the fabulous wealth of the
rich Americans, they feel quite small. So, focus on those who are
superior, to control your pride; whether it is about learning,
asceticism, Samadhi, or wealth. Your asmita will reduce.
And, the greatest of all is the Ishwara; no one is greater than Him.
A man who has a few acres of land feels he is a big man. The
Ruler of a State feels he is a big man. The President of a country
considers himself to be very important. However, this Cosmos
that contains millions of worlds is controlled by the Ishwara’s
Maya (power of delusion) and Prakriti (Nature). They glow and
vanish within minutes at the whim of the Ishwara. Who can be
greater than the Ishwara?
Shri Udiya Babji Maharaj would occasionally say, ‘Millions of
universes shine and fade out like sparks, in my essence. Every
universe has a Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. When I meditate
upon the Ishwara who is the Master of them all, what is the worth
of a paltry Samadhi that lies in a corner of my mind? What cause
is there for pride?’ Why should anyone have asmita because of his
learning, asceticism, Samadhi, or tranquility?
130

## Page 131

So, the aishvarya yoga (attaching the mind to the Ishwara by
thinking about His grandeur), meditating on His magnificence and
Glory, helps us to reduce our feeling of superiority. This is a part
of Buddhi Yoga.
Why the abhimana of being a great philosopher? People who live
by their intellect tend to have great pride. Some sit in solitude, and
write books, and some write poetry. But, what is this vichaara
(profound thinking)? Vichara is the restlessness of the antahkaran
(fourfold mind) in the body. When a person once realizes the
Satya (ultimate Truth), what need has he to continue to give deep
thought? Heeraa paayo gaantha gathiyaayo, baara-baara
baakoon kyun khole`? (You obtained a precious diamond and tied
it securely in your waistband. What is the need for you to open it
up to check again and again?)
Oh, the pride of Samadhi is broken, is it not? Our Atma is the
sakshi. It never sleeps, nor does it stay awake. It does not need to
flutter the wings of thought to go anywhere. Nor does it need to
trim the wings of thought to sit in peace. From whom does it feel
separate? The Atma is not divided by matter, indulgences, or
conditions. Hence, when we do vivek, and use discrimination, we
realize that nothing exists, except the Atma. Our asmita is cut
away.
Instead of focusing on our kartaapana (being the doer) and
bhokataapana (being the one who experiences), it is very good to
sit as a mere sakshi for a little while. However you must be aware
that this awareness is also something that you have chosen to do.
You invoke the feeling of being a sakshi, hold on to it for an hour
or so, and let the feeling go. When you come out of this feeling of
being unconcerned with everything, your usual inclinations and
tendencies flood into your mind once again. Therefore, this
saakshee-bhaava (feeling of being a sakshi) is a sadhana done by
a karta. It is not the Paramartha (supreme) Satya. It contains a
subtle ego, ‘I am like this, I have these qualities,’ etc.
You should know that when a person experiences Paramartha, the
‘asmi’ (am) in ‘aham brahmaasmi’ (I am the Brahman) is
131

---

## Page 132

dissolved, the ‘aham’ (I) is dissolved, and being the Brahman is
also dissolved. There are no words in the unbroken, infinite Satya
that is the Paramartha. In it, there is no tendency born of
inclinations. An effort to remove inclinations and tendencies is
required as long as you have agnaana (lack of Gnan). Under the
circumstances, Buddhi Yoga removes the asmita of being a
shakshi from the essence, and meditating upon the Atma’s
greatness also removes asmita.
Another point is that you continue to do your work, but put away
the feeling of being the one who works. There is a state of ‘tvam
padaartha (the ‘you’ in ‘You are the Brahman’), that is the
aishvarya yoga (being united with the Ishwara by focusing on His
greatness). There is the ‘tat padaartha’ (the ‘that’ factor), and
there is the state of vyavahaara (worldly interaction). This cuts
away the feeling of a separate ‘I’. How?
Aatmaupamye`na sarvatra samam pashyati yorjuna,
sukham vaa yadi vaa dukham sa yogee paramo matah.
(6. 32)
(O Arjuna, the Yogi who sees others the same as himself, and
feels their joys and sorrows as his own, is acknowledged as the
most superior Yogi.)
You can check up on this – there are many kinds of Yogis in the
Gita, but ‘Sa yogee paramo matah – this Yogi is, in My opinion,
the highest kind of Yogi.’ It is only in some places that Bhagwan
clarifies that this is not an ordinary Yogi; he is the highest kind. In
other places, a man is called a Yogi if he sits with his eves closed,
or controls his breathing, or sits with a straight back.
There is an organization – I can even give the name if anyone is
interested – where you pay two or three thousand rupees and get a
Certificate stating that you are a Yogi. ‘Le` khasam ko naama
khasama saun parichay naahin’ (she takes her husband’s name
but she doesn’t know her husband).

## Page 133

I am explaining the sadhana for destroying asmita. The asmi-asmi
(I am, I am), is always separate. It is drishya (that which can be
seen), and you are its sakshi. There is some individual quality you
have, and your subtle ego about being different from others is
utterly paltry before the Ishwara. The quality is insignificant, and
you are the one who witness it; you are in no way connected to it.
Furthermore, if there is any special quality, it is in all beings. This
is how you should view yourself. Now see, hasn’t asmita been cut
away?
There is a story about a Mahatma who was doing bhajan. Indra
(the King of the Devtas) sent his chariot and driver, Matali, to
bring the Mahatma to Swarga (Heaven).
‘Indra has invited you to come to Swarga,’ said Matali.
‘Why, Matali?’ asked the Mahatma. ‘Why should I go to Swarga?
I stay in my hut, doing Bhagwan’s bhajan. I bathe in the Gangaji.
I eat fruits and flowers, and the food brought by people. I remain
engrossed in the Paramatma night and day. What need have I to
go to Swarga?’
Matali returned to Swarga and told Indra what the Mahatma had
said. Indra went himself to bring the Mahatma.
This happens even with Rajas, Maharajas, and wealthy people.
They first send their employees, but if the person is great and
refuses to go, they come themselves. I have seen this on a number
of occasions. The Maharana of Udaipur invited Karpatriji Maharaj
with great respect. Karpatriji traveled leisurely. When he reached
Udaipur, he went to a park and sent word of his arrival.
The Maharana sent a senior Minister to bring Karpatriji to the
palace. ‘The Maharana is not feeling well,’ said the Minister. ‘He
has asked you to come to the palace and have bhikshaa (food
given to a mendicant). He will also be able to meet you.’
Karpatriji completed his daily routine of bath and worship. Then
he told the Minister, ‘Look, since Raja Saheb is not feeling well,
he won’t be in any condition to participate in any spiritual
discussion or listen to Satsang. So, instead of lingering here, I will
proceed on my journey.’
133

---

## Page 134

As soon as Karpatriji started, the Maharaja became well and came
to him personally! The health of the wealthy depends on their
mood! So, the good thing was that Indra came to the Mahatma,
and prayed to him to come to Swarga.
‘Indra,’ said the Mahatma, ‘Please tell me what is there in Swarga,
to make it worth my going there.’
‘There is great sukha (pleasure and comfort) in Swarga,’ said
Indra. ‘People fly in air planes. There are beautiful apsaraa
(celestial nymphs) frolicking in beautiful parks and gardens. You
will get amrita (the elixir of immortality) to drink.’
‘You vanity is false, Indra,’ said the Mahatma. ‘The sukha with
the apsaras is just like the sukha a dog gets with a bitch. The
sukha of amrita is like the sukha of a drunkard on earth. I have no
wish for your parks, or your apsaras, or your air planes, or your
amrita. I am happy by myself.’
The fact is that we feel that we lack the qualities others have. We
feel inferior and become agitated. So, the method for removing
asmita is to understand that if you are the saakshee (uninvolved
witness), you have no particular quality. Quality is drishya
(visible), and therefore, completely separate from you. Your
vanity is false. And, if you focus on the Ishwara, the quality you
have is of no great worth, anyway. If you view the people, all
have special qualities.
Aatmaopamye`na sarvatra samam pashyati yorjuna,
Sukham vaa yadi vaa dukham sa yogee paramo matah.
Who is a param Yogi (a Yogi of the highest caliber)? People sit
for an hour with their back straight, and consider others to be
inferior. There is only one Satya, and that is the same in all. If you
are totally entangled in your own sukha, you have an extremely
fragmented viewpoint. If you feel proud about what you have,
your pride will vanish. And, if you suffer from a feeling of
lacking, look at those who have even less. You will feel thankful
for what you have. If you eat a roti of bajraa (millet), and feel sad
134

---

## Page 135

that you did not get a roti of wheat, think about the person who
doesn’t get even bajra. He eats an inferior grain and drinks the
water that is discarded when rice is cooked.
People lament that they have only one room. They should think
about those who don’t have even a small room. Their feeling of
lacking will go. Thus, our possessions and qualities give us
vanity, but when we look at the Ishwara, our qualities become
negligible. When you become a sakshi, the virtue is no longer
yours, because you are nothing but an uninvolved observer. And,
if you understand that everybody has virtues and every home has
sukha, your asmita will reduce.
It is not enough to just think of the Ishwara, if you want to remove
asmita. It is necessary to take shelter in the Ishwara. Bhakti is a
separate thing, and sharanaagati (taking refuge) is a different
thing. The love Bhagwan showers upon us by giving us complete
faith, is sharanagati. Bhakti does not remove asmita completely,
but sharanagati does.
In the Sect of Shri Ramanuja Acharya, they believe that prapatti
(catching Bhagwan’s feet) and sharanagati are different. They also
consider maryaadaa bhakti (bhakti with decorum) to be different
from shuddha bhakti (pure bhakti). In the Sect of Shri Vallabh
Acharya, sharanagati means a conviction that Bhagwan will be
pleased with the things we do for pleasing Him. The faith is that
Bhagwan is pleased, and the sadhan (method) is our effort to
please Him. Our effort, and His being pleased. Sharanagati is
when both the sadhan and the saadhya (goal) is Bhagwan.
Yamaive`sha vrinute` te`na lakshyah.
(Mundaka Upanishad 3. 2. 3)
The ones who obtain Bhagwan are those who are chosen by Him.
In the Sects of Ramanuja and Vallabh Acharyas, the essence of
sharanagati is, ‘Shree krishna sharanam mamah, shree kishna
tavaasmi.’ (Shri Krishna, I take refuge in You. Shri Krishna, I
belong to You.’)The sadhana done by the jeeva (Atma attached to
a body) is one part, and the tremendous Grace coming from the
135

---

## Page 136

Ishwara is the other part; and sharanagati is possible only when
both are there. In this, the Ishwara’s stupendous compassion
removes the asmita of the jeeva.
Tame`va sharam gachha sarvabhaave`na bhaarata.
(18. 62)
(O Bharat! Take the sharan of the Parameshwara in every way.)
* * * * *
Sarvadharmaan parityajya maame`kam sharam vraja,
Aham tvaa sarvapaape`bhyo mokshayishyaami maa shuchah.
(18. 66)
(Give up all Dharmas, meaning, ordained duties; and take refuge
only in Me, who is all-powerful and the substratum of everything.
I will release you from all sin. Do not grieve.)
This Aishvarya Yoga is thus another form of Buddhi Yoga. Then,
there are Dharma Yoga (uniting with Him by doing Dharma) and
Karma Yoga (working as a worship), but the Gita does not give
stress to Dharma Yoga; it stresses on Karma Yoga. The Gita does
have love for Dharma, but there is a sakaamataa (desire linked to
religious rites) in it. The Gita describes the Karma Yoga that is
done after desires are removed. Apart from Karma Yoga,
vairaagya yoga (detaching ourselves from everything except the
Ishwara) is also a part of Buddhi Yoga. This is also called Bhakti
Yoga. Then, there is a third part, called the Sharanagati Yoga,
which removes asmita.
Apart from these, there is the samataa yoga (remembering that
Bhagwan abides in the hearts of all beings equally). All are equal
in the eyes of the Ishwara. All are equal when we sit as a sakshi,
and when we have equal goodwill for all in our worldly
interaction. A Yogi with such a feeling is ‘sa yogee paramo
matah.’

Tomorrow, I will tell you more about asmita. What is dukha
(sorrow/suffering)? It is the feeling, ‘I am the body.’ Another
dukha is the feeling, ‘I am bound by my likes and dislikes.’ The
third is the feeling of self-importance, and the fourth dukha is the
feeling, ‘The Paramatma, who is my ultimate goal, is separate
from me.’ The Gita tells us that all four dukhas are removed by
Buddhi Yoga.
137

## Page 138

Pravachan X
Removal of the fault of asmita – 2.
Let us think about the ‘Aham’ people have. Aham means ‘I’ (the
subtle ego of being an individual). When we use the word asti, it
means ‘is’, as in ‘the book is.’ When we use the word asi, it
means ‘are’, as in ‘you are.’ And when the word asmi is used, it
means ‘am’, as in ‘I am’. ‘I am’ comes within the range of
experience. Existing is an experience that nobody can negate,
because even the person who negates will experience, ‘I am’, that
he exists. The absence of existence cannot be experienced. This is
accepted universally.
Someone may say, ‘This is not a rose.’ The rose is seen in the
light, it is seen by the eyes, and it is seen in the five elements. It is
not separate from the light in which it is seen. It is seen by the
vision and is not separate from the vision. All such viewpoints can
be disputed, but nobody can deny the existence of the one who
sees.
Therefore, asmi, asmi, asmi; I am, I am, I am, is experienced. This
has three grades. One is that the person merges into what he sees,
and accepts it as himself. He can say, ‘I am the body, I am the
praana (life spirit), I am the mind, I am the kartaa (doer) and
bhoktaa (the one who experiences)’ etc. A person can identify
with any visible object, but that is not his shuddha sthiti (pure
state); it is ashuddha (impure).
Therefore, when a person interacts in this world and says, ‘I am a
Brahmin, I am a Sanyasi, I am this gross body, I am a man, I am a
living being, I am the one who works, experiences and remains
tranquil,’ it is because his ‘I’ has merged into all these.
The Yogi said, ‘Let me block these mental inclinations.’ Those
who practice Yoga are able to eliminate the ‘I’, or the feeling of ‘I
am’, but only for some time. This can be done. In this state,
asmita remains, but it is not connected to the personal inclination.
There is no clear discrimination with adhyaasa (all that is
138

---

## Page 139

superimposed on the pristine Atma). The blocked asmita that is in
the antahkaran (fourfold mind) remains. The antahkaran that is
blocked exists as asmita.
The Vedantis say that no matter how much discrimination you use
regarding asmita, and whether the vritti (mental inclinations) flow
or are blocked, as long as agnaana (lack of Gnan) about the asmi
is present, your feeling of being a separate individual cannot be
removed. You need to have Gnan about asmita’s actual essence,
and the essence of asmita is the non-dual Brahman. Consciousness
glimmers with the illusion of being separate in separate
antahkarans and bodies, but it is an illusion, not a reality, because
consciousness is one. Thus, the absolute removal of asmita is not
possible unless agnan is removed, that is, unless avidyaa
(nescience) is removed. Therefore, when the Brahman comes into
‘Aham brahmaasmi’ (I am the Brahman), the asmita of ‘asmi’ is
burst. As soon as avidya is removed asmita is also removed. This
is the principle of the Vedantis.
Now, when the sense of a separate identity is removed, the
perception that others are separate is also cut away, and our
poornataa (totality) is established. So, instead of talking about
Vedanta, I will tell you first about the methods of removing
asmita. I have laid the foundation of asmita’s removal, to clarify
that the other methods for removing asmita are not the Paramartha
(Supreme). Nobody should jump to the conclusion that this is the
actual removal of asmita.
To identify with some other object, and believe it to be your ‘I’, is
adhyasa. And, the experience of asmita felt by the drashtaa (the
one who sees; the Atma attached to the body) – or sakshee
(uninvolved witness) – is without the person becoming free of the
illusion of individuality, is negated; the asmita of being the
infinite Brahman remains, and that is ‘Aham Brahmasmi’. Later
on, not only is the Aham negated, the ‘Brahman’ and the ‘asmi’
are also negated. Only undivided existence remains.
There are three grades of the methods for removing asmita. The
aadhibhautik (gross matter), aadhidaivik (pertaining to the divine)
139

---

## Page 140

and aadhyaatmik (metaphysical). The Shrivansha Haripuran has a
long story, but I will narrate it in short for you. Naradji was once
doing a tapasyaa (asceticism) in the Gangaji. One day he saw an
enormous turtle, massive like a mountain. The turtle would put
out its limbs and withdraw them after some time. It would stick
out its head and withdraw it again, and remain unmoving. Naradji
was wonderstruck at the sight of this amazing turtle. ‘O Kachhap
Raj (King amongst turtles),’ he exclaimed. ‘You are wonderful!
You are blessed!’ The turtle smiled and said, ‘It is not I who am
wonderful and blessed. Gangaji, in whom I live, is wonderful and
blessed.’
Naradji told Gangaji, ‘Devi, you are wonderful and blessed.’
‘What is so great in me?’ replied Gangaji. ‘The sea is blessed; it is
wonderful. Thousands of rivers like me merge into the sea.’
Naradji went to the sea and expressed his awe. The sea said, ‘Not
me; it is the Prithvi (Earth), who is blessed and wonderful. She
upholds me as well as the mountains filled with precious gems
that are very important.’
‘What is so great about us?’ asked the mountains. ‘Brahma is
blessed and wonderful. The whole world exists in him.’
Up to this point, the story is about the aadhibhautik padaartha
(gross matter). Now it comes to Brahmaji, who is aadhidaivik
(divine). Naradji told Brahmaji, ‘You are wonderful and blessed.’
‘What greatness do I have?’ said Brahmaji. ‘The Vedas are great
and blessed. It is because of them that I am Brahma, bestowed
with all these riches.’
Naradji did a ritual worship of the Vedas. The Vedas manifested
before him. ‘O Vedas! You are wonderful! You are blessed!’
‘It is the Yagya that we rule over, who is great and blessed,’ said
the Vedas. Then Naradji worshipped the Yagya, and Yagya
personified and appeared before him. ‘You see, Prajapati (the
King) is the yajamaana (sponsor), the Vedas are Gnan, and we –
the Yagyas – are the action. The object of our worship is Vishnu.
Hence, it is Vishnu who is blessed and wonderful, not us.’

Vishnu means ‘vyaapakah ve`ve`shti iti vishnuh’ – the one who
pervades the whole world is called ‘Vishnu’. It is like the brown
paper in which a book is wrapped. Naradji decided to meet
Vishnu, but where was Vishnu? He made enquiries and came to
know that at that time, Vishnu was on earth. Naradji dropped
down to this earth. He saw Shri Krishna in the middle of a
meeting with Rajas. ‘You are wonderful and blessed,’ he said.
‘Yes,’ replied Shri Krishna. ‘I am blessed and I am wonderful, but
only with dakshinaa (monetary offering given to Brahmins),
because no Yagya is complete unless dakshina is given.’ It is the
rule of rituals that Bhagwan is not pleased with any ritual unless
dakshina is given.
Adhiyagyohame`vaatra de`he` de`habritaam vara.
(8. 4)
(I, Vasudev, abide in the heart of all, and I am the Adhiyagya.)
In the Gita you read what Bhagwan Shri Krishna is. All the
Yagyas are established in Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna is Vishnu.
What does He mean, when He says this? He thumps His chest and
declares, ‘Truly, I am blessed and I am wonderful!’
Now, what is this dakshina? It is vidyaa (right knowledge). If a
person knows the Paramatma, if he makes the avishay (that, which
cannot be the object of the senses) the vishay (object) of his mind,
then the Atmatattva (the essence of the Atma; the Brahman) that
is indicated, is wonderful and blessed. That is Shri Krishna’s
metaphysical form.
I once said to Shri Udiya Babaji Maharaj, ‘Maharaj, the Atma
cannot be the object of vritti (mental inclinations). How can we
obtain Gnan about it?’
‘From where have you heard this?’ he asked. ‘That the Atma is
the avishay of vritti – is this known, or not? If you have not
obtained this knowledge, tell me how you know this?’ It is,
therefore, a method of Gnan to state that the Atma is not an object
of mental inclinations. And, it has to be obtained by taking refuge
141

---

## Page 142

in a Sadguru (enlightened Master), and understanding through the
principle of the tradition of Vedanta. This is how the avishay
becomes the vishay; otherwise, any commoner would be able to
make the Atma the vishay of his mind.
So, you see, we first have to understand something about Shri
Krishna from the Gita, if we want to remove our asmita. Shri
Krishna’s Adhibhautik form stays with the people of Vrindavan.
He plays with the cowherd boys, takes the cows to graze, and
frolics with the gopis. He is even afraid of the gopis! That is Shri
Krishna’s gross, historical form. His Adhidaivik form is
Vaikunthanath – the Lord of Vaikuntha, where He abides
eternally as Vishnu; or the Lord of Goloka, where He abides as
Shri Krishna. It is wonderful.
If you seek to progress in the material world, you should respect
Shri Krishna’s ideals and goals. You should respect His good
qualities and universal benevolence. You should worship Him and
obtain worldly achievements. The Shri Krishna of the
Mahabharata is the Adhibhautik Shri Krishna, who can make you
win the battle. The Shri Krishna of Dwarka is also the
Adhibhautik Shri Krishna. You can obtain wealth by worshipping
this form of His.
The Shri Krishna of Vaikuntha and Goloka, however, is the
Adhidaivik Shri Krishna. You can obtain spiritual wealth by
worshipping these forms of His. You can go to Goloka or
Vaikuntha and obtain the treasures of these realms. The fault of
asmita in our lives is Adhyatmik. To remove it, we need to
worship the Adhyatmik Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna gives help
where it is needed. If you need external help, He gives it to you,
and if you need internal help, the Shri Krishna in your heart will
help you. To cut away asmita, you should think about the help you
can obtain from the essence of Shri Krishna, as given by the Gita.

amritam chaiva mrityushcha sadasachaahamarjuna.
(9. 18 – 19)
(I am the Supreme state that is worth obtaining, the one who
fulfills the needs of all, the Master of all, the one who bestows
good and bad fortune, the one in whom all abide, the best refuge,
the one who showers Grace with no thought of return, the cause of
birth and death, the one who sustains, the one into whom
everything dissolves during Dissolution, and the cause of eternity.
As the sun I give heat. I attract water and give rain. O Arjuna, I
am the amrita that bestows immortality and I am death. I am truth
and I am falsehood.)
Observe Shri Krishna’s ‘asmi’ (I am), and your asmi will be cut
away.
Rasohampsu kaunte`ya prabhaasmi shashisooryayoh,

(7. 8)
(O Arjuna, I am the fluidity in water, the effulgence in the sun and
moon. I am Om in the Vedas. I am sound in space, and I am the
valor in human beings.)
What scope is there for your asmi, when you see the asmi of the
Ishwara? Examine the twelve attributes of Shri Krishna’s asmi in
the eighteenth shloka of the ninth chapter. Your asmita will be
destroyed.
Shri Vallabhacharya has considered the jagat (world) to be
separate from the sansaara (the interactive world). The jagat is
created with the five elements. It has men and women, animals
and birds, etc. The sansara is created with ‘me’ and ‘mine’. Think
about the difference between the jagat and the sansara. There is a
woman; she is a part of the jagat. However, whether she is a wife,
a sister, aunt or grandmother are the relationships of the sansara.
A man is a part of the jagat, but whether he is a father, son,
brother or grandfather are the relationships of the sansara. Shri
143

## Page 144

Vallabhacharya says that the sansara is destroyed when we get
attached to Bhagwan; only the jagat remains. The woman will
remain, the man will remain; relationships that become a cause of
sorrow are eliminated. It is the sansara that causes sorrow, not the
jagat. No object is a cause of suffering – it is our likes and dislikes
that cause suffering.
If we cultivate a relationship with the Ishwara, our worldly
relationships will automatically be severed. We lose interest in the
world. Sansara means relationships, and relationships mean
sorrow. Now, if anyone present is an advocate of the Advaita
(non-dual) school of thought, he may accuse me of splitting the
world into two – the jagat and the sansara. Shankaracharyaji
Maharaj believes that they are one. I remind you that the
Panchadashi describes both the Ishwara’s srishti (Creation) and
the Jeeva srishti. Men and women are created by the Ishwara. So
are the other species and the elements. The jeeva srishti is to
consider them ‘my husband, my wife, grandfather, or
grandmother.’ Even Shankaracharyaji is of the opinion that there
is no sorrow in the Ishwara’s srishti. He says that the sorrows of
this world are not created by Prakriti (the Ishwara’s power of
Creation) or the Purusha (the Atma who abides in all). Then, who
creates dukha? It is avive`ka (lack of discrimination) that causes
sorrow. People lack the discrimination to separate the Ishwara’s
creation from the creation of humans.
There is the jagat, and it has a movement. It moves like a motor
car moves. Movement is called ‘gati’. ‘I am the gati of this car
called the jagat,’ says Bhagwan. ‘I am the driver who is
responsible for its being hidden at times and visible at times. It is
by My will that it moves fast or slowly.’ Bhagwan said, ‘Gatih – I
am the movement of this world.’ ‘Bhartaa – I am the one who
provides.’ What if this car needs petrol? Bhagwan provides the
force that moves the car that represents the world. He is the
bhartaa; He provides. Who is the owner of the car? It is Prabhu.
Bhagwan is the Master of this world. He is the saakshee – the one
who watches its movements. Where is this car kept? It is kept on
144

---

## Page 145

the earth. He is the nivaasa (abode), and the sharan (refuge) – the
garage!
And who cleans the car when it gets dirty? Who repairs it when it
breaks down? It is the suhrit (well-wisher). Who made it?
Bhagwan is prabhavah (Creation) and also pralaya (Dissolution).
Sthaanam – He is where the car is, and He is the nidhaanam into
which the whole world dissolves. Is it reborn, or not? ‘Avyayam
beejah’ – He is its indestructible seed. He is the whole world.
Now, think of what it is, that steals our ‘I’, starting from this gross
body.
Tapaamyahamaham varsham nigrihnaamyutsrijaami cha,
amritam chaiva mrityushcha sadasachaahamarjuna.
(9.10)
Tapaamyaham – the weather becomes unbearably hot. Who
increases the temperature? It is Bhagwan. There is rain. Who is it?
It is He. Bhagwan confiscates the motor car sometimes –
nigrhnaami, and releases it – utsrijaami cha. Sometimes He gives
liberation; He is amrita. And, He is mrityu (death). He is sat
(existence) and He is asat (a relative truth). Now, when He is
everything, where is your ‘I’, and where are your personal
relationships?
We believe a portion of the earth to be ‘mine’. This is a point you
may, or may not comprehend easily. People say, ‘I have paid this
amount for this land.’ Very well then, it is yours. ‘No, I inherited
it from my father.’ In that case, it is undoubtedly yours. ‘Oh, no!
It was gifted to me.’ Then it belongs to you now. ‘I seized it by
force.’ Well, you are its Master, now.
However, the earth will remain when you are no more. You have
attached your ‘me’ and ‘mine’ to this piece of earth, but neither
your ‘I’, nor your ‘mine’ are in it. Your death is on this earth and
your life is on this earth. This is how you are placed. All that is
seen as ‘mine’ is attached to your ‘I’. ‘Mine’ cannot exist without
‘I’. The offspring of ‘I’ is called ‘mine’. ‘I’ am not the owner of
145

---

## Page 146

‘mine’. ‘I’ comes first and ‘mine’ follows. (The ego comes before
possessiveness rises.)
Now, think of what your ‘I’ is, in the creation of the Ishwara,
when you focus on the Ishwara’s glory. The Mahatmas laugh at
those who say, ‘I own this land, gold, silver, diamonds and
pearls.’ The earth laughs and the water laughs. What is this ‘I’ of
yours, that entitles you to claim the world to be yours? When you
think of His greatness, where does your perceived greatness
stand?
Gatih bhartaa prabhuh saakshee nivaasah sharanam suhrit – He
is the master of the whole world! Prabhavah pralayah sthaanam
nidhaanam beejamavyayam – where does your feeling of asmi,
your ‘I’, come from and where does it go? What will it disappear
into? Where is it when you sleep? And, where is even that ego,
which does not pertain to worldly objects, in the Ishwara? And
then, what is even that, which seems to be present in the Ishwara,
in the sat-dhaatu (the element that is pure existence)?
I may have told you about this incident. I had once gone to a
Mahatma. I was about sixteen at that time. Ever since I was a
small child, I had heard about my grandfather’s conviction that I
would not live long. Discussions were held with astrologers. I
had gone to Kashi (Varanasi) for my studies, when I was twelve.
My grandfather sometimes took me with him when he went to
consult some astrologer. He would show my horoscope and they
would have extensive discussions about how long I would live. I
would listen to these discussions. Thus, it was imbedded firmly in
my mind that I would not live beyond the age of nineteen.
However, had that been true, I would not be alive today.
Another thing that happened is that I began to go to Mahatmas. A
factor of self-interest lay behind this. I hoped to find some
Mahatma who could extend my life span and postpone my early
demise. The Ishwara’s Grace was such that I never went to any
Mahatma who was a cheat, offering me some spurious medicine
to keep me alive. The Ishwara kept me safe from frauds. This is
why I say that the Ishwara showered Grace on me. ‘Yamaive`sha
146

## Page 147

vrinute` te`na labhyah.’ Only the one who is chosen by Bhagwan
obtains Him.
I was telling you yesterday that the love we give to the Ishwara
comes from our side, but His consent is required for the marriage
to take place. The marriage cannot take place unless He wants.
The Beloved is unseen; we have never seen Him. We don’t know
Him. So, were He to not bestow Grace on us, we could not feel
love for Him. This is how there are two kinds of varan
(acceptance). One is sadhana janakatra, when the person chosen
by the Ishwara begins to do sadhana. The other is when the
Ishwara annihilates the Aham in the one He has chosen, and the
person’s Aham merges into the Ishwara. These are the two
characteristics of people who have been chosen by the Ishwara.
Either the person begins to love the Ishwara or he becomes the
Ishwara’s.
Yes, then; what kripaa (Grace) did the Ishwara shower on me? It
was that I never went to any Tantrik who demonstrated super-
natural powers or imbued intoxicating substances. I went to
authentic Mahatmas. They told me, ‘We cannot delay your death.
If you are to die, you will die. However, we can make you free of
the fear of death. we have the capacity to rid your heart of its fear
of dying.’ What I am telling you is about asmita, about how the
Gita shatters asmita.
The fact is that doing a Yagya is not everything. The fruit of a
Yagya is the vritti (mental inclination; frame of mind) that rises
when we do a Yagya; it is the intellect that awakens in us. The
fruit of a Yagya is the tendency that gives us a reflection of
aatma-sukha (the bliss of the Atma). This is the fruit of doing
maalaa (a rosary). The fruit of going to a temple is the feeling, ‘I
have had a darshan (vision) of Bhagwan. I am fortunate!’ The
sadhana is external, but the fruit lies in the inclination of the
antahkaran (fourfold mind). Worldly people are not aware of this.
They think, ‘Bhagwan will send us a parcel of pearls and
diamonds. That will be the fruit of our bhakti.’
147

---

## Page 148

No. The fruit of your bhakti is that the reflection of the Atma –
whose essence is bliss – will shine in your heart. Actually the fruit
of every sadhana creates a kind of vritti in our heart, and the
shadow of the Atma in it is called the ‘fala’ (fruit). The fala is
always in the antahkaran, not in the Atma or Paramatma. Nor is it
in any object or action. The vritti’s merging into the Ishwara is the
fruit. People who don’t understand this expect some material
benefits to drop down from the seventh Heaven!
A man was very dejected. This happened recently, at Madras. He
had done an anushthaana (specific ritual worship) of Ganeshji. He
was deeply in debt and he wanted to obtain great wealth. He
wanted to get bundles of notes and become a millionaire within a
few minutes. He did the anushthan for this purpose, but he didn’t
get even a small coin. He felt utterly dejected and went around
telling people that his worship had yielded no results. This was in
spite of the fact that he received a letter from his creditor, saying
that in view of his plight, the man had written off his debt of fifty
thousand rupees. He was relieved of this enormous burden, and
yet he continued to tell people that he had obtained no benefits
from his worship of Ganeshji. ‘I wanted to get lakhs of rupees,’ he
lamented, ‘but I did not get even a single coin!’ This is vipareeta
buddhi (contrary intellect). The man did the anushthana and got
the fruit (of being relieved of a great debt) but failed to see the
benefit. The fruit of every anushthana comes as a mental
inclination, not as an external object. If, in spite of doing an
anushthana, your feeling is still that you lack something, what is
the value of that worship?
I told a Mahatma, ‘Maharaj, place me in the sharan (refuge) of
Bhagwan.’
‘Look, Babaji, Punditji,’ he said. I was seventeen or eighteen at
that time. ‘You understand everything. Tell me, what is there in
this world, that is not in the sharan of Bhagwan? Isn’t clay in His
sharan? Isn’t water in Bhagwan’s sharan? Aren’t fire, the sun, and
the moon ruled by Him? Aren’t the wind and space controlled by
Him? This body of yours is composed of the elements, it abides in
148

## Page 149

them, and flourishes in them. You call it your ‘I’. How can you
say that it is not in Bhagwan’s sharan? Go home now. Come back
tomorrow, and tell me what you feel is not in Bhagwan’s sharan. I
will place it in His sharan!’
The feeling of Aham we have is the asmita in our life, and it is
absolutely false. Come into Bhagwan’s sharan. We are not to go
into His sharan; it is the false impression of not being in His
sharan that is to be removed.. Take our eyes, for example. Aren’t
our eyes in the sharan of the light of the sun? Aren’t our ears in
the sharan of space, and our tongue in the sharan of rasa (flavor),
and our body – made of the five elements – in Him who is the
sharan of the elements? Everything is sheltered in the Ishwara.
Our asmita, our Aham, is absolutely false.

O Bharat, take the sharan of that Paramatma in every way. It is
only by His Grace that you will obtain supreme peace, and the
eternal supreme state.
I have thus given you this Gnan, which is the most secret of the
highly guarded secrets. Give it deep thought and then do what you
want.)
‘Eeshvarah sarvabhootaanaam hridde`she`rjuna tishthati – the

## Page 150

One day, I began to reflect upon this. If the Ishwara is seated in
everything, He will be present in the trees, and in the heart of a
clod of earth. Is He present in the drop of my blood? A drop of
blood contains millions of cells – is He present in every cell?
Sarva bhootaanaam hridde`she`rjuna tishthati. Bhraamayan (He
makes them go round and round) – left and right, high and low.
My blood moves with every breath I take. That is not what
bhraamayan means, although it does go up and down, and round
and round. Yantraaroodhaani maayayaa – seated on a machine
and moved by Maya.
Tame`va sharam gachha – go and take refuge in the Ishwara.
Meaning, whatever we consider to be ours. When this buddhi
changes, the asmita also changes. The changing of asmita lies in
the changing buddhi. And, when the buddhi absorbs the Satya
(ultimate truth; pure existence), when its subject is nothing but the
Paramatma, then asmita will be removed totally.
In the next two days I will tell you more about this.

Pravachan XI
The removing of the fault of asmita – 3.
I will tell you a little about vive`ka (discriminating between the
truth – the Atma; and the relative truth – the world that is
superimposed upon it). In the Sanskrit books, they write
‘atraayam vive`kah – this is the vivek about this subject.’ The
meaning of vivek is to separate. Vivek means the attempt to
understand the difference in the different objects, and separate
what has got mixed up.
Gatirbhartaa prabhuh saakshee nivaasah sharam suhrit.
(9. 18)
(I am the one who gives progress; I am the Master, the witness,
the abode, the refuge, and the well-wisher.)
This is the Ishwara’s form. The Ishwara is the sabeeja chit (the
consciousness that contains a seed), Prakriti (the Ishwara’s power
of Creation; Nature) is the sabeeja sat (existence that contains a
seed), whereas Goloka-Vaikuntha etc are sabeeja aananda (the
bliss that contains a seed). The sabeej Sat becomes the
aadhidaivik (divine) and the sabeej Chit becomes the aadhyaatmik
(metaphysical). Che`tan (consciousness) means our Atma. When
this is attached to the beeja (seed) of the whole world, it is called
the Ishwara, and when it is attached to an individual it is called a
jeeva. When both these superimpositions are removed, no
difference remains in the pristine consciousness. There is a kaarya
(effect, action) in the world, and there is a kaarana (cause).
Prakriti is the cause and this jagat (world) is the effect. In the
Adhidaiva are Shri Krishna and Shri Radha, Laxmi and Narayana,
Gauri and Shankar. And in the Adhyatma are the jeevaatmaa
(Atma attached to a body) and the vrittiroopa drishya (that which
is perceived because of individual inclinations).
151

---

## Page 152

Prakriti is dependent on her effect, the drishya (that, which is
seen); and the drashtaa (the one who sees) remains separate from
the drishya, as a disinterested witness. At this time, Prakriti stays
in the pancha bhoota (the five elements, earth, water, fire, wind
and space), and the Ishwara is both vyaavritta (encompassing) and
anuvritta (within). This is a mutually contradictory
dharmaashraya (state of Dharma; what is natural), because the
Paramatma is shuddha-buddha-mukta (pristine-enlightened-
liberated). Neither is He attached to anybody, nor does He
encompass anything. Shankaracharyaji’s experience is that the
Brahman is anuvritta as well as vyavritta. Shankaracharyaji’s
Brahman is neither all-pervading, nor separate; neither immersed
in the effect, nor separate from it, because there is no effect in the
Brahman. The drashta is separate from its drishya; the Ishwara is
both vyavritta and anugata (a follower; consequence), and the
pancha bhoota (the five elements) and other effects are always
anugata as the consequences. This is the point of vivek that I have
told you. So, see this in the Gita –
Amritam chaiva mrityushcha sadasacchaahamarjuna.
(9. 19)
(O Arjuna, I am the amrita [undying] and also mrityu [death]. I
am Sat and I am asat.)
This is the description of the Parameshwara’s essence – He is both
amrita and mrityu. A snake came to a bhakta, with its head raised
to strike. The bhakta said, ‘I have been separated from You since
a long time, Bhagwan! I have been unhappy at being parted from
You. You have sent this dear messenger to summon me to You!’
He was happy to see the snake. He began to dance with joy.
There was a Saint here, in Maharashtra. A ghost rose up high
before him. I am sure you know his name! ‘You look beautiful,
Prabhu! You have assumed this enormous form, but I recognize
You! Oh, this is not a ghost; it is my Parameshwara!’ Amritam
chaiva mrityushcha. For those who have recognized the
152

---

## Page 153

Parameshwara, He is amrita as well as mrityu.
Sadasachaahamarjuna – He is the truth and He is the false. If you
read the Gita attentively, you will find wonderful things in it. You
chant the Gita; pay attention to the words, and understand what is
said. Both the Sat and the asat are the Ishwara; and He is beyond
them, too – sadasachaahamarjuna (11.37)
Just think how tender would be the heart of the bhakta, how
sweet, full of joy and harmony it would be, to be able to see the
Paramatma in both death and immortality. What an extraordinary
person such a bhakta would be! Amritamchaiva mrityushcha
sadasachaahamarjuna.
Sadasat tatparam yat – He is Sat, He is asat, and He is beyond the
Sat and the asat. Do vivek and see one more special point in the
Gita – na sattannaasaduchyate` (13. 12). Neither Sat nor asat is
the name of the Paramatma. He cannot be described as Sat, or as
asat. Nobody can give a discourse describing Him as either,
because He is separate from both. Now see His essence as
described in the Gita.
Naasato vidyate` bhaavo naabhaavo vidyate` satah.
(2. 16)
(That, which is asat does not exist, and the Sat always is.)
On the one hand, Shri Krishna says that He is Sat and also asat;
and He is beyond them both. Sat-asat are kaarana-kaarya (cause-
effect); the Ishwara is separate form both. On the other hand, Shri
Krishna says that He can’t be called Sat or asat, and He
simultaneously states that the asat has neither birth nor death, and
the Sat does not have birth or death either! I have heard this
observation from a Saint.
I was staying with an organization that had a collection of all the
foreign publications of the Gita in different languages. There were
some one hundred and fifty versions that had different
commentaries in Sanskrit. For example, the commentaries of
Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, the Vigyan-Bhikshu Bhasya,
153

---

## Page 154

Bhaskar Bhasya, Madhusudan and Shankarananda’ commentaries,
etc. All these belong to the same Sect. None of these one hundred
and fifty commentaries had this observation, so I understand the
value of this insight. Those who have never studied it don’t realize
their importance. This Saint told me the meaning that I have just
told you. I have read a vast number of commentaries of the Gita,
but none had this point.
Asato bhaavo na vidyate` - the asat has no existence, no sattaa.
Not having satta means not being born. And, the indication is that
unless something is born, it cannot die. If you think about the son
of a barren woman, it is obvious that he will never die, since he
was not born. Therefore, asatah bhaavo na vidyate`, janma na
vidyate`, tadupalakshitam maranam na vidyate`. (What is not real
has no existence. Neither is he born, nor does he die.) That, which
does not die is not born either, because whatever is born has to
die.
The sat vastu (that, which can never be negated) has no janma-
marana (birth-death) and the asat vastu (that which can be
negated) has no janma-marana either. What this means is that
birth and death are not to be found. This is anirvachaneeya ; it is
something that cannot be defined. Both birth and death are
anirvachaniya. They seem to be real, but they do not exist. The
sabeeja (that, which contains a seed that can sprout in the future)
shaanta (tranquil) avasthaa (state) is called ‘Samadhi’; and the
vikshipta (agitated) moodha (dull) sabeej avastha is called the
‘sansara’ (interactive world). The chit (consciousness) that is
separate from the drishya (that which is seen) is the drashtaa (the
one who sees). The Ishwara is separate and He is also anuvritta
(attached). He has self-contradictory attributes. He stays in the
drishya, but is also separate from it.
The Brahman, however, is not separate like the drashta. He is not
filled in the jagat like Prakriti; nor does He have the self-
contradictory qualities of the Ishwara. Then?
‘Avyaavrittaananugataam.’ This is a watch. It is filled with
Prakriti. The drashta who sees it is separate from it. Prakriti fills
154

the gross body while the drashta remains separate. The Ishwara is
in the gross form of the body and He is also separate, because
nothing exists except Him; whereas the Parabrahm Paramatma is
neither anuvritta (attached) nor vyaavritta (encompassing). He is
neither separate nor does He pervade anything, because nothing
else exists.
Naasato vidyate` bhaavo naabhaavo vidyate` satah,
ubhayorapi drishtontastvanayostattvadarshibhih.
(2. 16)
(The asat has no existence, and the Sat cannot not exist. This is
how the enlightened Saints have seen them both.)
Today, I have started the discourse by talking about vivek. Now,
think about sadhan from this viewpoint. How proper is it to
consider this body – made of bones, flesh and skin – to be your
‘I’? The sabeeja shaanta sat (the pure state of peace that has the
seed of change) is called ‘Samadhi’. And, the sabeeja vikshipta
chitta (the restless consciousness that has a seed) is called the
Ishwara, and the sabeej shanta aananda (the peaceful bliss that as
a seed) is called Vaikuntha or Goloka. I want you to examine
where you are seated, and where you wish to stay.
Ubhayorapi drishtontastvanayostattvadarshibhih.
Twelve characteristics of the Ishwara, and six of the jeeva. The
Brahman has neither twelve nor six characteristics in the Gita, so
how can I describe them to you? The Ishwara’s characteristics are:
Gatirbhartaa prabhuh saakshee nivaasah sharanam suhrit,
prabhavah pralayahsthaanam nidhaanam beejamavyayam.
(9. 18)
(I am also the absolutely desirable supreme realm, the one who
fulfills all needs, the Master of all Creation, the one who bestows
everything auspicious and inauspicious, the abode of all, the one
155

---

## Page 156

worthy of taking refuge in, the one who benefits without
expecting anything in return, the cause of the origin and
dissolution, the one who sustains and supports, the one into whom
all are immersed at the time of Dissolution, and the indestructible
cause of everything.)
Count them – they are twelve. Now, see the six characteristics of
the jeevaatmaa (the Atma attached to a body).
Upadrashtaanumantaa cha bhartaa bhoktaa mahe`shwarah,
paramaatme`ti chaapyukto de`he`sminpurushah parah.
(13. 22)
This Atma, established in the body, is in fact, the Paramatma. He
watches everything, so He is the upadrashtaa – the witness who is
very close. He acquiesces in whatever we do, so He is the
anumantaa He sustains us all, so He is the bhartaa. As the jeeva,
He is the bhoktaa – the one who experiences everything. He is the
Master of Brahma, and other Devtas, so He is the Maheshwara.
He is called the Paramatma because He is sacchidaananda -
existence, consciousness and bliss.
The param purusha, the Supreme being, stays in this gross body,
but has been given many names. However, all these are His
names. The meaning is, is there a purusha (man) in this world
who is not related to anyone? What are a husband and wife? ‘My
husband, my wife.’ They are sambandha purusha – each is related
to the other. And, the meaning of para purusha is a person who is
not related. There is a purusha inside the body, but he is perceived
as a separate individual, as the Aham, Aham, Aham of each
individual.
The Atma has three faults. One is that the Aham, Aham, Aham
keeps changing. If you tell me that your Aham doesn’t change, I
will ask whether you have ever observed it carefully. Watch it
closely; you will see how it changes umpteen times daily. ‘Aham
dukhee (I am sad), aham sukhee (I am happy). I did a good deed. I
did something I shouldn’t have done.’ The Aham latches on to
156

---

## Page 157

changing mental inclinations, becoming happy and sad. You will
observe one Aham, two Aham, three Aham, four Aham, etc. The
Aham changed with time. It is not external; it is internal. It
changes according to the tendencies of sukha-dukha (joy-sorrow),
paapa-punya (sin-spiritual merit), etc. It changes as time passes,
one after another, and it is within, not in the outer world. This is
your Aham.
Purushah parah means that the one who is in the constant feeling
of Aham-Aham that flows on; and the consciousness that feels
happy or sad is the param purusha. There is an aham that is
separate from the individual Aham. The Aham in the body is
called ‘upadrashta, anumanta.’ He sits in the eyes and sees. He
gives consent to your thinking. To say that He gives anumati
means that he does not oppose your thinking, whether it is sinful
or pious. He does not even oppose anger. I tell you this because it
is unlikely that there is anyone here who does not get angry at
times. If a person gets angry and someone asks why, he will say,
‘I’m doing the right thing.’
Jaun satha danda karaun naheen toraa, bhrashta hoyi shruti
maaraga moraa.
(If I don’t punish you, you fool, let my path to Swarga be
blocked.)
The man who got angry abused and slapped the other man. After a
couple of hours, the shaitaana (Devil) of anger left him. The one
who takes control of the mind of a fool is called a Shaitan. Anger
never comes to an enlightened person. After anger left him, the
man said, ‘Oh, I made a great mistake by losing my temper,
giving abuses, and hitting the other man.’
Well, why didn’t you accept your mistake at that time?
‘At that time, I had merged with my anger. Now I am free of it.’
It is the same with lust. People feel, ‘All the delights of the world
are in this. This is what life is all about.’ It is the same with greed.
The meaning of anumanta is when we identify with the present
157

---

## Page 158

mental inclination. Later on we become separate from the
momentary impulse. So, the Atma in the individual gives the
consent and then detaches himself from the impulse. The fact is
that even while consenting, you are actually separate. You are the
upadrashta.
There is a drashta and there is an updrashta. There is a President
and there is a Vice President. There is a Chairman and there is a
Vice Chairman. In the same way, there is a drashta and there is an
updrashta. ‘Upa’ means ‘close to’. Drashta means the one who
abides in the body and sees everything.
I had told you that a stream flows along with the Aham. The
Aham-Aham-Aham changes with time. It is within the boundaries
of space. It is imprisoned; and thirdly, it sits astride whatever
comes. Its vehicle is not fixed. Vishnu Bhagwan rides on the
Garuda (eagle), Brahma on a swan, and Shivaji on a bull. What
does your Aham ride on? The answer is that sometimes it rides on
a donkey, and sometimes on a horse or a crocodile. Your Aham
has no fixed vehicle. It is carried by kaama (lust) and you become
a kaamee (full of desire). It rides on krodha (anger) and you
become krodhee (angry). When it is carried by lobha (greed) you
become lobhee (greedy). Your Atma has no fixed vehicle. It
changes according to the prevailing emotion. That being the case,
you must be careful.
Upadrashtaa anumantaa cha bhartaa bhoktaa mahe`shvarah.
The essence of the Atmadev is extraordinary. The Atma is the
Master. He is the provider. He derives enjoyment from
everything, and controls everything. All these are His different
states. He is the upadrashta when seated on a momentary impulse.
He is the anumanta when seated in the mind. He is the bharta
when He gives people the awareness of existing and prompts them
into action. He is the bhokta when you feel at peace, and He is the
Maheshwara because He controls everything. And, what if you
stop identifying with the individual Atma? Then, He is none other
158

---

## Page 159

than the Paramatma! Who is called the Paramatma? It is the name
of the Atma, the name of the param purusha. It is the name of the
essence that is beyond the purusha. Where does the Paramatma
stay? He says here – asmin de`he` - in this body.
Now see the fourth point. Three things rise up at times in the
drashta, and are quiet at times. They are, to identify with the
fluctuating mental inclinations, to simply remain within this gross
body, and to flow from one mental condition to another. When
does this happen? It happens when a person is attached to a body.
When you realize that this drashta is the Paramatma, ‘Brahm
sampadyate` tadaa (13. 30) – this drashta is the Brahman’, it is
what the Gita says.
We are talking about sadhana – the effort for spiritual progress.
You sit on the dirty vehicle of your gross body that is composed
of bones, flesh and skin, and believe it to be your ‘I’. This is
called ‘abhinive`sha’. It is like going into someone else’s house
and going to sleep. To go into your gross body and go to sleep
means to not know your own essence, not know who you really
are. So, when you start doing vivek, your abhinivesh in your body
will be removed.
There is a Gnani (one who has Gnan) who shouts at me
sometimes. ‘I am a Gnani! What do you think I am? I will not
incur sin even if I steal or become violent, because I have
obtained Gnan. I am a Gnani!’
Tell me, now, where is this Gnani seated? He is seated in his gross
body. Stealing is done by the body. Had he not identified with his
body, he would not say such things. Well, Maharaj, if you are a
Gnani, live with sadaachaara (ethically). Observe decorum.
When we preachers begin a pravachan, the command of all the
Shastras is to begin with something auspicious. That is decorum.
‘No, I don’t like to bow my head before anyone.’ Had you not
identified with your head, you would not consider bending your
head to be your bowing.
‘I am a Gnani. Why should I bow my head?’ Only a fool thinks
that bending his body means that he is bending. And then he
159

---

## Page 160

considers himself to be enlightened! This is called ‘abhinivesh’. A
Tattvagnani (one who knows the essence of the Brahman; an
enlightened person) has no relationship with his body. This is the
first sword of Tattvagnan.
Is the Tattvagnani’s body in Kashi (Varanasi) or is it in the house
of an untouchable? What difference does it make, once the
identification with the body has been removed?
Look at another sword – what is the biggest insult given by
worldly people to a Mahatma? It is when they accuse him of
having raaga-dve`sha (attachment-aversion). This is the attack of
worldly people. Thus, the first weapon of Tattvagnan is the
removal of identification with the gross body, and the second is to
be mentally aloof from being effected by what is outside the body.
Raga is a sweet poison. When a person imbues a sweet poison he
does not realize how it harms him. This is why raga is said to be
worse than dvesha. Dvesha is a fire that burns the heart in which it
rises. The person becomes aware that he hates the other. I can tell
you this, that if you get an impulse to harm someone, to lead him
astray; or feel that he is inferior and despicable, you have dvesha
in your heart. You can disdain him or abuse him as much as you
like but he is not what you think he is. That person is not one
person; all Creation is hidden in him. You would not behave in
this manner unless there was dvesha in your heart.
And raga? Raga means partiality. Somebody asked Mahatma
Gandhi, ‘You are a satyaagrahi (an advocate of righteousness).
What is the need for brahmacharya (celibacy), for being a
satyagrahi or serving the people? Why do you bring in satya
(truthfulness), ahinsaa (non-violence), brahmacharya, aparigraha
(non-accumulation), abhaya (fearlessness), aste`ya (not coveting
other people’s possessions), and sarvadharma samatva (equality
of all religions), etc?’
‘You see,’ explained Mahatma Gandhi, ‘If we are conscious of
being two – I, who have raga, and the one for whom I have an
attachment – there will be a desire that we two should get good
clothes and food, etc. We will have an inclination to serve the one
160

---

## Page 161

we love, and not all society. Raga is such that it makes us sever
our relationship with the rest of the world. It makes us disdain our
Guru, the Ishwara, the Vedas, our Dharma etc. It makes us say,
“O Ishwara, please protect the one I love. Please fulfill all his
wishes.” Raga is ruinous. This is why Brahmacharya is necessary
for doing social service. In Tattvagnan, nothing exists except the
Atma, so who is there to love or hate?’ Thus, the second onslaught
is on raga-dvesha.
The third onslaught of Tattvagnan is, as you know, that there is no
scope for asmita.
Nityah sarvagatah sthaanurachaloyam sanaatanah.
(2. 24)
(This Atma is everlasting, all-pervading, unmoving, unchanging
and eternal.)
Nityah sarvagatah sthaanuh – don’t be amazed at this; it is a
description of your Atma. It is a description of you! Whose is the
description – na jaayate` mriyate` vaa kadaachit? Is it the
description of the Parameshwara? No, it is not the description of
the Parameshwara; it is a description of you. The Parameshwara is
described elsewhere, and His description if different. Na
hanyyate` hanyamaane` shareere` - the body will die, but not the
Atma. This statement refers to you; not to the Ishwara.
There is no question of the Ishwara’s dying. Therefore, this is a
description of you. Na hanyate` hanyamaane` shareere`; na
jaayayte` mriyate` kadaachit; naayam bhootvaa bhavitaa vaa na
bhooyah. Ajo nityah shaashvatoyam puraano na hanyate`
hanyamaane` shareere`. (2. 20)
(This Atma is not born at any point in time; nor does it die. It is
not subject to birth or rebirth. It is unborn, everlasting, eternal and
ancient. It does not die when the body dies.)
It was your belief that you will die along with your body. Arjuna
believed that Bhishma-Drona would die when their bodies were
161

---

## Page 162

killed. Shri Krishna said this to explain that this belief was false.
He wanted Arjuna to understand that Bhishma’s Atma would not
perish with his body. Neither would Drona’s. Arjuna’s Atma
would not die when his body died. This is said to explain the same
thing to you. Even the commentators of the dvaita (duality)
philosophy agree that this is the description of the essence of the
jeevaatmaa (Atma attached to a body). After this, it is clarified
that the Atma – meaning you – is sarvagata, vyaapaka – it is all-
pervading. It is not restricted by space.
Nityah sarvagatah sthaanurachaloyam sanaatanah.
Ayam (this) has been added to sarvagatah (all-pervading). The
Atma is all-pervading. Does this mean that the Atma pervades the
body from tip to toe? No, this is not the meaning. The meaning is
that the Atma pervades all creation. It is free from the limitations
of space. It is what reveals the presence or absence of the
divisions imagined in space. How wonderful is this Atmagnan! It
batters your asmita.
Think about a Yogi who achieves a Samadhi. ‘I can sit in a
Samadhi, but others are worldly people.’ However, when a person
who meditates on the drashta says that he is the drashta because
he is able to achieve the state of being an uninvolved witness for a
little while, he remains a drashta who is seated in one body. He
says that all others are a kartaa (doer), bhoktaa (the one who
experiences), and sansaaree (worldly). He says that they are all
baddha (bound to the world) and parichhinna (separate
individuals). The fact is that a drashta can be a drashta only when
he is the uninvolved observer of everything, not just his own mind
or body. He will be the drashta of undivided time, space and
matter. He will be the drashta of the jeeva, the Ishwara, and
Prakriti. If his being the drashta has the experience of the non-dual
Brahman, it is authentic. If not, he is sitting in solitary
confinement for a while and is the drashta of his mind. This is
nothing but asmita.
162

---

## Page 163

When will the state of being a drashta destroy asmita? It will
happen when he no longer identifies with his body.
Upadrashtaa anumantaa cha bhartaa bhoktaa maheshvarah.
Saakshee che`tan ke`valo nirgunashcha. This saakshee
(uninvolved witness), the che`tan (consciousness), ke`vala
(solitary), nirguna (without attributes), is an attack of Atmagnan
on our asmita. It removes the feeling of Aham (I) that is attached
to an individual. Then, what does Tattvagnan do? See how it
purifies! It is not that you are the Brahman when you sit in
Samadhi and something else when you interact with others. A
person is the Brahman when he cuts himself off from the states of
Samadhi and vikshe`pa (disturbance). He is the Brahman in any
case.
The reason is that Prakriti (the Ishwara’s power of Creation) is the
kaarana (cause) and the jagat (world) is the kaarya (effect). The
Ishwara is avyakta (unseen) and the world is seen. Shri Krishna is
the karana and Shri Radha is the karya. Shri Krishna is the
Purusha and Shri Radha is Prakriti. They are Adhidaiva (divine
forms). The cause and effect are Adhibhoota (gross matter
composed of the five elements); and the drashta-drishya (the one
who sees, and that which is seen) are Adhyatma (metaphysical).
Laxmi-Narayana are Adhidaiva, as are Gauri-Shankar. And, what
is the Brahman? He is Kaivalya. When they are two, it is the
grihastha-dharma (the rightness of a married householder).
Radha-Krishna are the Grihastha Dharma. The drashta-drishya are
vaanaprastha (the third stage of life when people turn to
spirituality). The drashta-drishya are not Sanyas; they are not the
fourth stage of life which means total surrender to the Ishwara. It
is not Kaivalya. And, karya-karana are not Dharma; they are
vikaara (distortion; mutation). The Adhibhoota has vikara and
pre`ma (pure love). Radha-Krishna have prema. And Adhyatma
has the non-dual approach of the Vanaprastha stage. The yugal-
163

---

## Page 164

dharma (the rightness of the dual form) is not present in the
Parabrahm Paramatma. The Gita describes the non-dual Brahman.
Anaadi matparam brahm na sattannaasaduchyate`.
(13. 12)
(This supreme Brahman is timeless. He can neither be called
‘Sat’, nor ‘asat’.)
Sarvatah paanaipaadam tatsarvatokshishiromukham,
sarvatah shrutimalloke` sarvamaavritya tishthati.
Sarve`ndriyagunaabhaasam sarve`ndriyavivarjitam,
asaktam sarvabhrichaiva nirgunam gunabhoktri cha.
(13. 13-14)
(His hands and feet are everywhere. His eyes, head, mouth and
ears are everywhere, because He pervades all Creation.
He knows all the objects of the senses, but is actually free of the
senses. He has no attachments, but fulfills the needs of all, and He
supports everything. He has no attributes, yet He experiences all
attributes.)
You should understand which fault of your life is being removed
by your sadhana. The purpose of your sadhana is to remove the
faults in your life. If none of your faults are being removed, what
you are doing is not a sadhana. Think deeply and repeatedly about
this, and understand it well. This understanding is not
Brahmagnan; it is vivek. Vivek is the first part of external
sadhana.
From vivek comes vairaagya (detachment), and from vairagya
come the six virtues called the shat-sampatti. Then, the person
gets the urge to be liberated from rebirth. This urge is called
mumukshaa. All these are external sadhans.
Vivek is an external sadhana. The internal sadhans are shravana
(listening to spiritual discourses), manana (meditating on them),
and nididhyaasana (bringing the mind back repeatedly to the
object of worship). The realization that the Atma and the Brahman
164

---

## Page 165

are one is a direct experience. It is not the result of an enforced
mental state achieved through effort. The enforced state contains
kartaapana (the subtle ego of being the doer), and kartrittva
(doing). It needs to be repeated. Once a person obtains Tattvagnan
– the direct experience, or realization – there is no need for it to be
repeated. This is the saakshaat (experienced directly) sadhana.
Next, I will tell you abut the method of sadhana given in the Gita.
165

## Page 166

Pravachan XII
A life united with the Ishwara is the complete and lustrous life.
All the Shastras give sanskaara (refinement). They remove the
dosha (faults) in the things we accumulate, do, indulge in, say,
feel, think, and in the state we live in. They are like a mother who
cleans her child and teaches him good habits. These things have to
be taught; they do not come naturally. People who think that an
inspiration will suddenly flash in their mind one day, and set
everything right, leave their life’s upliftment to chance. To leave
your life to chance indicates attachment for worldly objects. It is
not an indication of love for the Atma.
‘One day, Bhagwan will shower Grace on me, and I will become
enlightened.’ ‘The Truth is within me; it will emerge when the
time is right.’ ‘One day I will find a bundle of notes and become
rich.’ All such thoughts are absolutely wrong. Even if someone
gets an inspiration, it will be because of the sanskaras of the
Shastras from a previous lifetime. A seed is needed, before it can
sprout. If a seed of the right sanskaras is not yet planted in your
mind, you should plant it now, without further delay. It is essential
to do this. Therefore, when anyone induces you to give up
studying the Shastras, or doing Satsang (listening to spiritual
discourses), and tells you to sit alone, don’t get carried away by
what they say. If you do, you will become a slave of your desires,
because desires rise up when a man sits alone and gives himself
up to his thoughts.
We have to go to a dentist and get our teeth cleaned, when they
get covered with tarter. This is a sanskara of the teeth. This is
called ‘dosha nivritti’ – removal of a fault. When the teeth are
polished to make them shine, it is a sanskara called
‘gunaadhaana’ – inculcating a good quality. And, if a missing
tooth is replaced by an artificial one, it is a sanskara called
‘heenaangapoorti’ – replacing a part that is missing.
166

## Page 167

Similarly, you should give some thought to the faults in your life,
the good qualities you lack, and the factors that restrict your
wholeness from being revealed. If the cause is naasamajhee (lack
of understanding), that is also a fault. You should try to remove it.
What I want to tell you is that the Gita wants an overall
enhancement of your life. For instance, you can see that the Gita
wants your bhoga (indulgence) to become Yoga (uniting you with
the Ishwara). Enjoy pleasures, but do so as a Yoga.
Yukataahaaravihaarasya yuktache`shtasya karmasu,
yuktasvapnaavabodhasya yogo bhavati dukhahaa.
(6. 17)
(Yoga destroys sorrow. It is established successfully by a person
whose intake, exercise, work and sleep are moderate and healthy.)
‘I want your sorrow to be destroyed – yogo bhavati dukhahaa.’
When will sorrow be destroyed? It will be destroyed when faults
are destroyed. Sorrow cannot be destroyed if faults remain.
Someone may tell me that he wants his physical ailments to be
destroyed first; dosha and dukha can be dealt with later.
Yuktaahaaravihaarasya. Eat wisely and work wisely. Do some
physical work every day. Keep your conjugal indulgences within
healthy limits. Do not succumb to anger, mentally, verbally or
physically. A person who practices this will not be prone to
disease.
To not have droha (ill-will). Droha doesn’t mean killing or
abusing. Those are the characteristics of hinsaa (violence). Droha
is the impulse to harm or hurt someone. Hinsa is to do something
to cause suffering to another, and droha is when a wish to hurt
someone rises in the mind. It makes a human behave like an
animal. Hinsa is not manushya-dharma – it is not the innate nature
of a human; it is pashu-dharma (right for an animal). Therefore,
yuktaahaara-vihaarasya – there should be no sorrow in the life of
a person whose lifestyle, intake, etc are moderate and ethical.
Keeping the senses controlled is like riding a well-trained horse.
167

---

## Page 168

The senses are not to be blocked; they are to be controlled. People
should live like human beings, not like animals.
Abhinive`sha is a disease that makes you identify with your body.
The Gita recommends yuktaahaaravihaarasya for this malady.
Let your intake and pleasures be yukta (what is right, leading to
goodness). That means, all your indulgences should remain within
the limits of what is right and proper. Nothing is more harmful
than flouting the norms of what is right and proper. There is no
sukha (happiness) in excess, no real, enduring pleasure.
Yuktache`shtasya karmasu – your work and effort should be
yukta. This is Karma Yoga. It means that you should not remain
idle. Your effort should always be to do what is right and proper.
Maa te` sangostu – akarmani (2. 47). (Don’t be the cause of
karma and don’t be attached to it either.) This conquers Tamo
guna, the lowly tendency of sloth and delusion.
Yuktasvapnaavabodhasya – it is not right to indulge in excessive
sleep or staying awake too long, and have irregular hours. There
should be discipline in your daily habits. Waking and sleeping are
in time; actions are done by the body; intake and enjoyment are
done by the senses. Actions are done by the karme`ndriya (the
organs of action), and should be disciplined. Aahaara-vihaara are
done by the gnaane`ndriya (sense organs) and should also be
disciplined. Furthermore, the sleeping, dreaming, and waking
states should be regulated.
The fact is that we have to realize our goal. Let us forget about
those who have no goal in their lives. A person wants to aim with
his gun. Yuktaahaara-vihaarasya. The gun in your hand should
function efficiently. In the Ramayana there is a description of Shri
Rama teaching Sitaji how to use a bow and arrow, when they
were at Chitrakoot. Bhagwan Rama knelt on the ground and
encircled Janakiji with His arms. He showed her how the bow
should be held, how the arrow should be placed, and the angle
from which she should view the target. He was teaching her how
to hit the target. He explained how the feet and arms should be
168

---

## Page 169

positioned and the eye focused. Thus, if we want to achieve our
target in life we have to learn discipline.
Here is one more point. This applies to everyone who interacts in
this world, but particularly to a saadhaka (spiritual seeker). It is
about how a sadhak should be yukta, how he should remain
attached to the Ishwara when he is in Samadhi, when he is doing
sadhana, and even when he reaches the siddha avasthaa (state of
spiritual success). You will enjoy reading this! You should remain
yukta as you interact in the world. You should not be ayukta (not
attached to the Ishwara). You should first examine yukta and
viyukta (separated). When you do your work, do you sit within
yourself, or do you go outside yourself?
When someone loses his temper, people say, ‘Aape` se` baahar ho
gayaa hai.’ (He has lost control over himself.) The Muslims
generally use this phrase for someone who is overcome by lust.
The Hindus use it for someone who is overcome by anger. The
meaning is that they have lost their self-control.
Desire and anger arise in every mind, but should they be allowed
to gain mastery over us? There is a gentleman who sometimes
loses his temper with me. When he is in a rage, he says things that
he should not utter. At that time, he does not see me as a
Mahatma. He describes me as a duraatmaa (a wicked person).
‘Look!’ he says, ‘this wicked self is your real self. You don’t
know how bad you are, but I know! Take a good look at yourself!’
Saying this, he thrusts a mirror at me.
Hence, in our interaction with others, it is necessary to eat and
enjoy, sleep and stay awake. However, if you lead the life of a
sadhak, you must go beyond that. Some people recommend that
when we get angry, we should allow ourselves to give vent to our
anger, succumb to lust when desire flares up, and steal when
greed rises. You may believe this to be psychologically beneficial.
I have no objection to your praising this theory at home. I know
that modern psychology is opposed to repression. However, it is
my humble appeal to you that you don’t teach this theory to your
children. Would you tell your wife to do whatever she is tempted
169

---

## Page 170

to? Can any wife tell her husband to fulfill his every impulse?
When it is not possible for a husband and wife to give such
license to each other, and nor can any parents allow such freedom
to their children, there is obviously some flaw in this theory.
How can you depend upon the mind to always remain on the right
track? When we travel in a car, we think that the people walking
on the road have not been taught how to walk in traffic. They
should not come before cars the way they do. And, when we walk
on the road, we feel that the drivers have no thought for the
pedestrians! Is this not our state of mind? It is a daily matter for us
to blame the other. We must be constantly alert about this. The
force of desire is extremely strong. Nobody can prevent desire
from rising, but it cannot be allowed to induce us to do or say
whatever we feel like.
Shaknoteehaiva yah sodhum praakshareeravimokshanaat,
kaamakrodhodbhavam ve`gam sa yuktah sa sukhee narah.
(5. 23)
(A person who succeeds in controlling the waves of desire and
anger in this lifetime is a Yogi, and only such a person is truly
happy.)
The first point was ‘Yogo bhavati dukhahaa’. Now Shri Krishna
says, ‘Sa yuktah sa sukhee narah.’ He says that not only is his
sorrow destroyed, he also gains true happiness. Kaama (desire)
and krodha (anger) come due to past sanskaara (subtle
subconscious impressions). They may be inherited from
grandparents, childhood companions, education, or entertainment.
Everybody knows how babies are born. Thus, desire and anger
can and do rise up on their own, but two things must be
remembered. One is, don’t let your intellect justify them, and the
second is, don’t act upon them. A gangster may enter your house,
but it would be foolish to ask him to come into the storehouse of
your valuables.

It is the nature of kama and krodha to be known only after they
have come. It is not possible to be aware of them until they are in
your mind. And, when they come, the right thing for you to do is
to grind them completely. How should you grind them? Just as
grain is ground in-between two slabs of stone. What are these two
slabs? One is to not bring kama and krodha into action, and the
other is to refuse to condone their existence. Don’t abuse the other
person when anger comes. Don’t do anything immoral when lust
comes. Don’t steal when greed comes. Deal with them as you deal
with dreams that come and go; ignore them. Don’t think, ‘That
was a beautiful thought.’ Think, ‘That was an improper thought.’
Start doing meditation. Apply a brake to wrong thoughts. If you
do this, your children, wife and other family members will all lead
ethical lives. On the other hand, if you allow yourself to indulge in
wrong practices, it will have an adverse effect on the whole
family. The sanskaras of a good character will be ruined. The Gita
advocates a life of self restraint.
Shaknoteehaiva yah sodhum praakshareeravimokshanaat.
This message is meant for your lifetime, my brother. A corpse
can’t do anything. If you are a sadhak, and want to have sadhana
in your life; if you have life in you, why do you say, ‘If the enemy
comes, let him. If he shoots, let him.’
In this, there are two factors. It is not possible to prevent kama-
krodha from coming into the mind, but it is possible to stop them
from being put into action. It is one thing to feel a spurt of anger
but you can control your hand. You lift it when you want to eat
something or brush away a fly. Your hand moves when you want
it to move, so even though you cannot control the feeling of anger,
you can control your body and not let anger be converted into
action. Don’t lose control over your hand or tongue.
The other factor is to not allow your intellect to support your
anger. Anger plays one role and action plays another role. If you
want to tread the path of sadhana and hit your target, you will
171

---

## Page 172

have to keep your gun pointed straight at it. Focusing on your
target is called ‘sadhan’.
Yuktaahaaravihaarasya – your aahaara (intake) and vihaara
(pleasures) should be regulated and proper. I understand the
viewpoint of those who say that vive`ka (discriminating between
the Sat and the asat) leads to vairaagya (detachment), and that
vivek is Gnan. It is true that everything will be set right when
vivek comes, but you have to try to bring vivek into your life!
There is a difference between vivek and brahmaatmaikya gnaana
(the Gnan that the Brahman and the Atma are one). It is one thing
to know that the Atma and the Brahman are one, and another
thing to have discrimination about what is beneficial and what is
harmful.
I will tell you a third point. Buddhi (the intellect) and kriyaa
(action) are used for the sadhana. So are vichaara (profound
thought) and karma (rituals). Kama-krodha, however, are not
done; they come on their own. Neither vichara nor karma come
naturally; they are done; whereas desire and anger not voluntary
actions, they are involuntary impulses. Action is a physical
activity and deep thought is a mental activity.
The jeeva identifies with the body when he acts, and identifies
with the intellect when he thinks. Desire and anger come when the
jeeva identifies with the mind. A person is aware of kama and
krodha only after they rise up. They come in the forms of past
actions and memories. Therefore, they are not pramaana
(established facts). They are the fluttering of an inclination. They
flutter and become quiet. And, who is it, who doesn’t do this? It is
a corpse! This is what ‘praak-shareeravimokshanaat’ means.
Jaake` samuhe` dushman baithe` vaake` jeevanako dhikkaara.
(Shame on the man who allows his enemies to sit before him.)
This is a popular folk song called ‘aalhaa-udalakaa’. The
indication is, shame a sadhak who does not strive to overcome his
enemies – kama and krodha. They are shut up in the chamber of
172

---

## Page 173

the mind, and keep smoldering like live coals. They are like the
fireflies that glow during the rainy season. Kama-krodha glow
when the Atma identifies with them. When do they stop shining?
They stop shining when we identify with the intellect and refuse
to condone their existence. They fade away when we refuse to
accept what is not right, and refuse to act according to their
urging. So, if you see someone wearing a beautiful watch, don’t
let yourself be tempted into taking it – you may have to go on a
trip to the big house (prison)! Don’t destroy sadhan.
Shaknoteehaiva yah sodhum prakshareeravimokshanaat.
Now we come to the next point. In it, the seeds of raga-dvesha are
rendered fruitless. If actions are not prompted by attachments or
aversions, these two faults are washed away.
Let us go further. Someone may say, ‘Very well, Maharaj, kama-
krodha remain no more. But, this mind is very restless.’ Pay
attention to the word ‘yukta’. ‘Yuktaahaaravihaarasya
yuktache`shtasya karmasu,’ and, ‘praakshareeravimokshanaat
kaamakridhodbhavam ve`gam sa yuktah.’ Two kinds of yukta
(attached to Bhagwan) have been mentioned here. Now see the
third kind.
This – the third kind of yukta – is wonderful! It is the pinpointed,
focused mind. It is not that we should let our mind be restless if it
wants. It is only when we practice vivek that we realize that it is
not we who are restless; it is the mind that is restless. The vive`ka
kaala (the duration of discrimination) of Sankhya Darshan and the
sthiti kaala (the duration of a particular state of mind) of the Yoga
Darshan are different. If you observe where the kartrittva (the
subtle ego of being the doer) is, you will realize that the
movement of kartrittva is amazing. A human being’s feeling of
being the doer is so strong that we never realize that our ‘I’ does
not move when our mind flits from subject to subject. The Yoga
Sutra says, ‘Vritti saaroopyamitaratah (1. 4) – we identify with
temporary mental urges.’ When kama arises we feel, ‘I am a
173

---

## Page 174

kaamee (filled with lust).’ When krodha arises we feel, ‘I am a
krodhee (angry).’ When lobha arises we feel, ‘I am a lobhee
(greedy person).’ The saakshee (impartial witness) has to be
attached to the aabhaasa (perception) before he can realize that he
is restless.
Yadaa viniyatam chittamaatmanye`vaavatishthate`,
nihsprihah sarvakaame`bhyo yukta ityuchyate` tadaa.
(6. 18)
(A person is called ‘yoga-yukta’ – completely united with the
Ishwara – when he manages to achieve total control of his mind,
and establish it in the Paramatma. At that time, he loses all interest
in everything worldly.)
The state of today’s businessmen is such that their Buddhi Yoga
(attaching their intellect to the Ishwara) has been developed by
going to Satsang (spiritual discourses), but their first love remains
the bundles of notes! See where they are going. They are not
attached to their wives; they are attached to their lady-loves. That
is the flow of their inclination. They do not value the salary they
earn, the money obtained through honest work. What they value is
black money. Their priority is their hidden wealth and hidden lady
love. Even their enmity is hidden so well that the enemy does not
even realize that he is hated. This is their secret essence.
If this is your secret essence and it is established in your mind, I
hope you will not feel offended at the point I want to make. Please
note that your hidden lover is separate, your hidden enemy is
separate, and your hidden wealth is separate. Now you ask why
your mind is restless, why it doesn’t stay still!
You can sit in an aasana (Yogic posture) with your hands in the
correct position and eyes half closed. You can invite your mind to
come within, and sit in you. Your lover is in one place, and you
think about how her eyes move, and your mind goes to her and
then comes back to you. You keep the object of your love outside,
174

---

## Page 175

and want your mind to remain inside. You love the bundles of
notes and want your mind to settle within.
Take the example of a woman who serves food to her husband.
This is the time when her lover goes down the road every day.
The woman serves one roti to her husband and pauses by the
doorway to catch a glimpse pf her lover. Then she gets him
another roti and pauses by the door again.
You want your mind to be still, but how is that possible, when you
have so many worldly attachments? You taunt the Sadhus, saying
that meditation is useless. You quote the psychologists who say
that it is harmful to control the natural inclinations of the mind.
The fact is that you are going against psychology. You look for
hundreds of known faces when you walk on the streets. At times
your mind is on the safe in your house, and at times it is on the
locker in the Bank. Somebody’s mind is in another’s house, or at
his shop, and yet you tell your mind to be still and stay within?
How is that possible? This is why they say that as long as the one
you love and the one you hate are outside, as long as you fear
some external danger or discomfort, your mind will be restless.
You may comfort yourself by saying that meditation is a trick by
the Sadhus, but you will not achieve what you want.
Yadaaviniyatam chittam aatmanye`vaavatishthate`,
nihsprihah sarvakaame`bhyo yukta ityuchayte` tadaa.
This ‘yukta’ is asking whether your mind is focused.
Yathaa deepo nivaatastho ne`ngate` sopamaa smritaa,
yogino yatachittasya yunjato yugamaatmanah.
(6. 19)
(Just as the flame of a lamp does not flicker when the air is still,
the mind of a Yogi is steady when focused only on the
Paramatma.)
175

---

## Page 176

E`kaagra means single pointed. A Yogi’s mind remains fixed on
the Paramatma. It is as steady as a flame that is protected from all
air currents, because it is not distracted by worldly thoughts. This
is what the state of your mind should be. You think that you can
offer a cheap garland and reach the peak of dhyaana (meditation)
in three minutes! Or, that you can give three thousand or three
lakhs to someone and attain the state of Samadhi! But, these have
no value. Some magician or hypnotist may create an illusion, but
that does not mean that you have done dhyana.
Yadaa viniyatam chittamaatmanye`vaavatishthate`,
nihsprihah sarvakaame`bhyo yukta ityuchyate` tadaa.
As long as you want to cling to the things you like, how can you
be yukta (attached only to Bhagwan)? A dog goes looking for
food. A beggar does the same. Your mind does not want rotis; it is
a beggar for sukha (happiness; pleasure). It goes to one sense
object and gets sukha, then to another, and then to a third. When
your mind stops going to sense objects for sukha – when you
become nihsprihah sarvakaame`bhyo - then you will be called
yukta. This is the sukha of a sadhak.
The elementary sadhak refuses to cooperate with the faults in his
actions and intellect. ‘Kaama-krodhodbhavam ve`gam sa yuktah’
is the sadhak who has progressed. And, the sadhak of
‘yuktaahaaravihaarasya’ is one who is tempted by sense objects.
The sadhak who has reached an elevated state is the one whose
mind is focused unwaveringly on Bhagwan.
This is not the summit of sadhana. Sadhana stays for a while and
vanishes. It is like the doctor who comes to your house, treats you,
and goes away. Sadhana gives an outlook that has to be kept in
mind at all times. What is that outlook?
Karmanyakarma yah pashye`dakarmani cha karma yah,
sa buddhimaan manushya`shu sa yuktah kritsnakarmakrit.
(4. 18)
176

---

## Page 177

(The man who sees akarma – lack of karma – in karma, and sees
karma in akarma, is an intelligent man. He is a Yogi who does
everything.)
Be the yukta who is of the highest kind. It is a person whose
outlook remains unchanged whether he is doing sadhan, or
interacting in the world. And, what is that outlook? It is to keep an
eye on the kartaapana (the subtle ego of being the doer). You sit
quietly, without doing anything, and feel that your essence is the
drashtaa (detached observer). That is true; but what you are to
observe is whether this condition (of being the drashta) remains
twenty four hours, or just for that one hour or so. The one hour
condition is an artificial condition achieved through a conscious
effort. It leaves you when you relax the effort. Therefore, the
kartaa (doer) is present there.
See, the Gita’s yukta – what is he like? He is ‘akarmani cha
karma yah.’ When you think that you are not doing anything,
merely observing, you are actually doing a karma. Your legs are
either folded or spread out. Raja Yoga is done with the person
sitting on a chair with legs stretched out. The Adhiraja Yoga is
done lying on the bed, and the Maharajadhiraja Yoga is done even
when eating, drinking, or sitting on a throne. I have not imagined
these names – they are described in the great works of the Yoga
Shastras, Vedanga, Samhitas, etc.
You should keep in mind that when you do anything voluntarily
you become the karta. You will be a karta as long as you work
and not be the karta when you remain idle. ‘Karmanyakarma yah
pashye`d’ – I am the karta even when I place my legs in a certain
position, straighten my back, keep my eyes half shut, and think
that I am not doing anything.’ Achieve the attitude of the being a
drashta whether you do anything or not. The drashta never sleeps.
He does not strain to stay awake; he is awake even when the
person sleeps.
Na hi drashturdhrishte`h viparilopo vidyate` avinaashitvaat.
(Vrihadaranyaka Upanishad 4. 3. 24)
177

---

## Page 178

Is this also while doing sadhana? Yes! ‘Tadaa
drashtuhsvaroope`vasthaanam.’ In that case, what is siddhi
(spiritual success)? I will tell you –
Gnaanavignaanatriptaatmaa kootastho vijite`ndriyah,
yukta ityuchyate` yogee samaloshtaashmakaanchanah.
(6. 8)
(A person whose antahkaran is fully satisfied with Gnan and
vignana is not affected by mental distortions. His senses are
restrained. He is equally disinterested in a clod of earth, a stone or
gold. It is said that such a person is yukta and he obtains
Bhagwan.)
You will note that this yukta is not in Samadhi; is interacting in
this world. How? Samaloshtaashmakaanachanah - a clod of earth,
a stone and gold are all the same as far as he is concerned. A
person can worship Shivaji in a clay Shivaling, or a stone
Shivaling, or one made of gold. The clay is the loshta, the stone –
maybe picked up from the Narmada – is ashma, and the gold is
kanchana; but are they really three, as far as he is concerned? No,
for him they are one.
Let this pass. What about a clod of earth lying on the ground, a
stone lying on the roadside, or the gold in the safe at home? Who
can be equally uninterested in all three? Would he be in a
Samadhi or would be interacting in the world? Oh, this is that
Paramartha (supreme state) that remains with him whatever he is
doing. You will wonder how this can be possible.
It is possible only if the person is yukta. ‘Yuktaahaaravihaarasya’
was the first characteristic. Now, see the fourth –
‘Gnaanavignaanatriptaatmaa’ . The person who is fully satisfied
because of his Gnan and vignaana (Gnan that is applied). This is
not the description of a person in a state of Samadhi. This person
is eating. People find satisfaction in eating the specialties of
different cuisines. Is a yukta’s satisfaction derived from food? No;
178

---

## Page 179

his tripti (complete satisfaction) comes from his Gnan and
vignana.
Is this vritti saaroopya (identification with the current
inclination)? Oh, no! He has not kaama-krodha-lobha (desire-
anger-greed). He is kootashtha – unaffected like a goldsmith’s
anvil.
Are his senses controlled? Certainly! Jite`ndriya! A yukta has
succeeded in keeping his senses under control, he remains
unaffected, and is fully satisfied because of his Gnan and vignana.
In worldly interaction, he remains equally indifferent to a clod of
earth, a stone, or gold, since none of them are of any use to him.
He has no need to forget or remember anyone, build a stone
house, or sell the gold in the market. Furthermore, he remains
yukta even if he holds on to some inclination, builds a stone
house, or sells gold. He is always established his Self.
I told you about who is yukta – always attached to Bhagwan. A
person can be yukta with the predominance of the tvam padaartha
(the ‘you’ factor. The ultimate statement of the Vedas is ‘Tat tvam
asi – That [the Brahman] is you’, the Atma) or, the ‘tat padaartha
(the ‘that’ factor), or the factor of oneness (asi). In the Gita, yukta
means a Yogi. A Yogi is disciplined. You saw how his intake and
pleasures are disciplined, and there is a discipline even in his
sleeping and dreaming states. A person who is yukta can
experience desire or anger, but he won’t get carried away by
them. He never allows his intellect to justify their existence. This
is the second characteristic. The third characteristic of a yukta is
that he controls the restlessness of his mind, and the fourth is that
he continues to remain a disinterested observer, whether he is
active or inactive.
Gnaanavignaanatriptaamaa kootastho vijite`ndriyah,
yukta ityuchate yogee samaloshtaashmakaanchanah.
See how the Gita does the sanskaara (enhancement) of your life.
How wide is the range of improvements, staring from what you
179

---

## Page 180

eat and drink, right up to the ultimate joy of jeevan mukti (being
liberated from worldly concerns), and absolute contentment. The
Gita does the sanskara of your antahkaran (fourfold mind) and
external life. The Gita does the sanskara of your indulgences are
accumulations, your actions and inclinations, condition and states.
It removes faulty understanding and outlooks. It gives you the
knowledge that the Atma and the Brahman are one. The Gita
gives wholeness to your life, making it bright and effulgent. This
Gita is our Mother. She improves us in every way, the way a
mother improves her child.

Pravachan XIII
The most yukta kind of life.
Yesterday, I told you that the Gita explains how a person’s life
can be enhanced step by step, from the very basics, right up to
fulfillment. The aahaara-vihaara (intake and pleasures) being
yukta are the first step. Our lifestyle should be disciplined, and
within the framework of what is right and proper. Do you know
what the boundaries of what is right and proper are, according to
the Gita? You would have noticed –
Naatyashnatastu yogosti na chaikaantamanashnatah.
(6. 16)
(This Yoga is not for people who eat too much or too little.)
Nobody who overeats can practice this Yoga successfully; nor can
anyone who starves himself. The Gita recommends balance and
moderation. There should be a balance even in our intake. This is
where the description of a yukta begins. After that, Shri Krishna
says that kaama-krodha (desire-anger) may rise up in the mind,
but they should not be allowed to cross over the boundaries of
what is right and proper. A person can get angry with his disciple
or son, to remove his bad habits. When the anger is prompted by
an intention to benefit another, it doesn’t harm the one who gets
angry. It is the intention that must be benevolent. This is how we
can use our intellect to conquer kama-krodha and not allow it to
be transformed into action.
In anger, if attachment for someone is the cause of anger for
another, the benevolence is not for the person with whom you are
angry; it is for the person to whom you are attached. It is the
nature of pre`ma (love) that when you love one person, you
become disinclined to hear the version of the other. That,
however, is not prema; it is aasakti (attachment; infatuation). The
181

---

## Page 182

Gita accepts that raaga-dve`sha (attachments-aversions) will arise
in the mind, but tells us not to let them overcome us.
Indriyasyaye`ndriyasyaarthe` raaga-dve`shau vyavasthitau,
tayorna vashamaagachhe`ttau hyasya paripanthinau.
(3. 34)
(Attachments and aversions are inherent in every one of our
senses. A human being should not be controlled by them, because
they are enemies that obstruct the path to liberation.)
Indriyasya-indriyasya pratye`kasya indriyasya – the repetition of
the word ‘indriya’ (senses) means, of every person, every
individual. Every sense of every individual has its own likes and
dislikes. However, ‘Tyorna vashamaagachhe`t’ – we should not
controlled by the preferences of our senses. That is why self-
restraint is mentioned whenever the characteristics of a yukta are
described.
Taani sarvaani sanyamya yukta aaseeta matparah.
(2. 61)
(When the controlled mind is established in the Paramatma.)
You are yukta. That means, you lead a life that is right and proper.
You are in a position that is right and proper, and your actions are
right and proper, done at the right time. This is exactly what is
meant by yukta. Then, Bhagwan tells you to control your mind.
Yadaa viniyatam chittamanye`vaavatishtha te`.
(6. 18)
(It is said that the person whose mind is focused completely on the
Paramatma is yukta.)
After this, Bhagwan Shri Krishna tells you to cultivate an outlook
that enables you to obtain complete satisfaction from the Gnan
that the Atma is unchanging and all-pervading. Gnan is the
182

---

## Page 183

essence of the Atma. A person who can cultivate such an outlook
remains fully satisfied, whether he is in a Samadhi or in worldly
interaction. He is the highest kind of yukta. ‘Karmanyakarma yah
pashye`dakarmani cha karma yah. Sa buddhimaanmanushye`shu
sa yuktah’ – ‘Gnaanavignaana triptaatmaa kootastho
vijite`ndriyah. Yukta ityuchyate` yogee.’ What the Dharma
Shastras call ‘Sanyas’ (taking the vows of renunciation) is called
anaasakti (non-attachment) by the Gita. As long as it was called
‘Sanyas’, it was restricted to the aashrama (stage in life) of
becoming a Sanyasi (monk). The Gita made it universal. I will tell
you a couple of points about this.
The Gita establishes the characteristics of a yukta, starting from
his food habits and pleasures, up to the level of absolute
equanimity. However, all these descriptions are from the
viewpoint of the tvam padaartha (the ‘you’ factor. The ultimate
statement of the Vedas is ‘Tat tvam asi’, meaning, ‘you are that.’
That means, the Atma in you is the Brahman.) These descriptions
are dominated by the tvam padartha. You can review them all.
The description of the sthitapragya (in the second chapter) is
obviously about the tvam padartha. You can take shaknoteehaiva
yah sodhum’, or ‘yadaa viniyatam chittam’, or
‘gnaanavignaanatriptaatmaa’, or ‘karmanyakarma yah
pashye`d.’ The yukta is in them all as the tvam padartha.
So, Bhagwan Shri Krishna said, ‘No, My child, don’t be satisfied
because you have become a yukta. I don’t want you to be limited
to this state.’ Shri Krishna uses both suffixes – taram (better) and
tamam (best). At that time – and also in the Vedas – both these
have been used. ‘Shre`thatamam kavinaam,’ and ‘na manushyaat
shre`thataram kinchit’ are both from the Vedas. The Gita says,
‘guhyaat guhyataram – more secret than an ordinary secret.’
You have become a yukta; that is very good. Your bhoga
(pleasures), sangraha (accumulation), karma (actions), and
indriya (senses) are all restrained and proper. Your faults have
been removed. You have cultivated good qualities and replaced
what you lacked. Mother Gita grooms and guides her child, and
183

---

## Page 184

carries him up to the point beyond which even she can’t go. This
is what is called sanskara – she removes all faults and lacking.
The faults that the Gita removes are abhinive`sha (identification
with the body), raga-dvesha, and asmitaa (pride). You have
become totally satisfied because of your Gnan and vignaana
(applied Gnan) – gnaanavignaanatriptaatmaa. You have become
kootastha –(unaffected), vijite`ndriya (conquered your senses),
and samaloshtaashmakaanchana (equally indifferent to a clod of
earth, a stone and gold). Is anything left?
Yes, there is something more for you to obtain. Come, I will lead
you to the svatahsiddha (self-established) paripoorna pada (state
of wholeness). I will take you to the Ishwara. How can one meet
the Paramatma? You can meet the Paramatma in two ways – one
is through shraddhaa (faith) and the other is through Gnan.
There is one point to be considered here. Tapasvibhyodhiko yogee
(a Yogi is greater than an ascetic). It is true that a Yogi is greater
than a tapasvi; and, ‘gnaanibhyodhi matodhika’ – greater than a
person with great knowledge. In the opinion of the Gita, worldly
knowledge, and knowledge about the Shastras, are of little value
unless and until the person becomes a Yogi. Controlling kama-
krodha and the senses are forms of asceticism, but they can’t be
compared to the greatness of a Yogi. Even among the karmi
(those who do religious rituals), the Yogi is considered superior. It
is a good thing to become a Yogi.
Tapasvibhyodhiko yogee gnaanibhyopi matodhikah,
karmibhyashchaadhiko yogee tasmaad yogee bhavaarjuna.
(6. 46)
(A Yogi is superior to a tapasvi. He is regarded as greater than
those who have Gnan about the Shastras and do rituals for
fulfilling worldly desires. O Arjuna, be a Yogi.)
Even among the Yogis there is one kind who is greater than the
others. He is able to cross over the tvam padartha and reach the
184

## Page 185

Paramatma by developing a personal relationship. Bhagwan now
tells us to go to Him.
Yoginaamapi sarve`shaam madgate`naantaraatmanaa,
shraddhaavaanbhajate` yo maam sa me` yuktatamo matah.
(6. 47)
(Of all the Yogis, the one who has faith in Me, and worships Me
constantly and wholeheartedly, is the one I consider the greatest.)
Think about shraddha. Shraddha is a highly elevated quality. It is
not a minor factor. ‘Naashraddhaanaa aavirvishanti de`vaah’ –
the Devtas do not accept the offerings of people who lack
shraddha. ‘Praatahshraddhaamavaavahe` - I evoke shraddha.’ Do
bhajan (loving worship, devoted singing) with shraddha. We have
not yet seen the Paramatma, so what should we do?
‘Madgate`naantaraatmanaa’ – our Atma is the tvam padartha.
‘Madgat – let it come to Me.’ ‘Madgate`naantaraatmanaa – let
the Atma in you merge into Me.’ Let the clay of the pot merge
into clay, let the drop of water merge into the sea, let the inner
space merge into the all-pervading space outside. Let the
kaaryopaadhika (that, which is superimposed on the Atma as the
effect) be merged into the kaaranopaadhika (that, which is
superimposed on the Atma as the cause). Let the superimposed
individuality merge into the superimposed totality. Let the things
that are superimposed due to agnaana (ignorance) merge into that
which is free of all superimpositions.
What will happen then? Then you will be yuktatam (a yukta of the
highest caliber). Very well, I may be yuktatam, but I will still be
connected to shraddha. I have not yet had the aparoksha
saakshaatkaara (direct personal experience of the essence of the
Brahman).
All right, I will tell you about aparoksha sakshatkara. You have
become yukta, you have acquired all the qualities needed for
becoming yukta. For example, yuktaahaaravihaara – your intake
and are indulgences are yukta. Your senses are controlled; so are
185

desire and anger. Your mind is tranquil. You see akarma in karma,
and karma in akarma. You are fully satisfied because of your
Gnan and vignana. Now, merge into the tat-padaartha (the
Brahman) and become yuktatam (the highest kind of yukta). The
meaning of this is that when you merge your parichhinna
(individual self) into the aparichhinna (the non-dual whole), you
will be yuktatam. Yukta (attached to Bhagwan), yuktatara (more
yukta) and yuktatam (most yukta).
All right, then, you have become the highest kind of yukta. You
have achieved this through shraddha, by merging the inner Atma
with Bhagwan’s Atma. You have not done this through bodha
(direct knowledge). How is that achieved?
Bhagwan begins to discuss the aparoksha gnaana (the Gnan that
is a direct personal experience) in the seventh chapter.
Mayyasaktamanaah paartha yogam yunjanmadaashrayah,
asanshayam samagram maam yathaa gnaasyasi tachhrunu.
(7. 1)
(Bhagwan said, ‘O Partha! You have unlimited love for Me. Your
mind is attached to Me, and you think about Me all the time. Your
inclination is for Me alone. I will tell you how you will know My
Glory, magnificence, power and qualities; that I am the Atma of
all.)
‘Samagram gnaasyasi – there will be nothing lacking in your
Gnan.’ This is the pledge.
Yajgnaatvaa ne`ha bhooyonyajgnaatavyamavashishyate`.
(7. 2)
(Once I have given you this Gnan, there will be nothing left for
you to know.)
The Upanishads state that there is a vignana that gives the vignana
of everything. This is a pledge made by the Upanishads. Now, the
question is, how can the science of one thing give the science of
186

---

## Page 187

everything? This is not possible, unless everything is the same
thing. That is true; the One is, in fact, everything that exists. The
jadavaadi (materialists) say that everything is gross matter. There
is a flaw in this argument. When you say ‘this’, the object you
refer to is separate from you. Unless the ‘I’ exists, how can ‘this’
be established? People say, ‘this’ is also ‘I’, and therefore, it is
one. Oh! How can ‘this’ be one? The one who knows ‘this’ will
remain separate. He will be the drashtaa (the one who sees) of
‘this’. He will be separate form ‘this’. It is wrong to say that ‘this’
is one. Even after you obtain the knowledge of ‘this’, you have to
obtain the knowledge of ‘I’.
The jigyaasu bhakta (the bhakta who wants to know the Brahman)
says that ‘That’ is one. My brother, even ‘That’ needs ‘I’ to
establish its existence. According to those who hold this opinion,
bhakti is vive`ka (discriminating between Sat and asat). We know
a Mahatma who talks on vivek. He says, ‘Yam e`kam bhaktih, yam
anya bhaktih, yam dviteeya bhaktih, yam triteeya bhaktih.’ (This
is one bhakti, this is another bhakti. This is the second bhakti, this
is the third bhakti.) Bhakti means a portion, a division,
discriminating between the different things. Therefore, separating
the unseen Ishwara from the world known through the senses –
the pratyaksha srishti – is called bhakti. When a person separates
himself from the pratyaksha, he becomes a drashta; and when he
separates ‘That’ from the pratyaksha, he becomes paroksha (not
known through the senses). But, what is it, in all this, that gives
the vignana about everything?
Asanshayam samagram maam yathaa gnyaasasi tatshrunu,
gnaanam te`ham savignaanamidam vakshyaamyashe`shtah.
Yajgnaatvaa ne`ha bhooyonyajgnaatavyamavashishyate`.
(7. 1, 2)
(Hear about the knowledge that I am giving you. I am the Atma of
all.

## Page 188

For your sake, I will speak about the Gnan and the vignana of the
essence of the Brahman. Once you have this Gnan, you will need
no further knowledge.)
There is one Gnan that is so wonderful, that once it is obtained,
there is nothing further that needs to be known. Observe this –
madgate`naantaraarmanaa!’ Shankaracharya Bhagwan has
mentioned this elsewhere, and Madhusudan Saraswati probably
referred to this in the example he gave. A clerk serves his
employer – madaashraya – the employer is his ashraya (refuge;
source of sustenance), but is his aasakti (attachment) to his
employer? No. His asakti is to his family and his own body. He
gets his income from his employer, and depends upon him for his
monthly income. He renders service to his employer, but his love
is for his family and himself.
What if a person has attachment for the Ishwara but the Ishwara is
not his ashraya? Then he will not attain Gnan. It is only when the
Ishwara is the ashraya and the object of attachment as well, that
he will obtain the samagram gnaana – the Gnan about totality.
Therefore, if you wish to obtain the Gnan about everything by
obtaining Gnan about ‘this’ or ‘That’, or your ‘I’ being separate, it
is not possible. It is only when the ‘I’ that is pure consciousness –
the Atma who is the drashta – experiences oneness with the
Paramatma who is both the cause and the effect of this world, that
the Gnan of everything comes. Even if the experience is merely an
indication that is accepted with shraddha, the world will not seem
separate once the person gets the feeling that everything is the
Brahman.
The Gnan of the Parameshwara being everything – time and space
included – is essential for the sadhak to obtain that special Gnan
which gives Gnan about everything; and this Gnan has to be the
same as our own consciousness. If one object can exist as a
separate object, the ‘I’ who sees it remains separate from what is
seen. Neither can ‘That’ exist separately, because the ‘I’ who
believes in ‘That’ remains separate from it. However, if the
188

---

## Page 189

substratum of ‘That’ and the substratum of ‘I’ – the drashta – is
one; meaning, the substratum of the world and the Brahman are
one and the same, and a sadhak experiences this himself, then this
one vignana reveals the vignana of everything.
Yajgnaatvaa ne`ha bhooyonyajgnaatavyamavashishyate`.
(Once you know this, there will be nothing further for you to
know.)
This is why –
Na hi gnaane`na sadrisham pavitramiha vidyate`.
There is nothing as purifying as Gnan. In the Gita you read:
Sarvabhoote`shu chaatmaanam sarvabhootaani chaatmani,
eekshate` yogayuktaatmaa sarvatra samadarshinah.
(6. 29)
(A Yogi who is constantly seated in the infinite, all-pervading
consciousness, and is attached to his own Atma, who sees the
presence of the Atma in all beings, and that all beings are
perceived in the Atma.)
What is this? This is what is called the ‘tvam padaartha’. Tvam
padartha means ‘I’, the Atma. See this, also:
Yo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati,
tasyaaham na pranashyaami sa cha me` na pranashyati.
(6. 30)
(A person who sees that I, Vasudev, pervade all beings, and sees
that all being exist in Me, sees Me continuously. Such a Yogi sees
Me all the time and is constantly seen by Me.)
The characteristics of both are the same. Everything is in the
Atma, and the Atma is in everything. Everything is in the
Paramatma, and He is in everything. Yo maam pashyati sarvatra
189

---

## Page 190

sarvam cha mayi pashyati – lakshanaikyam lakshyaikyam. When
the lakshana (characteristics) are identical –
Sarvabhootasthitam yo maam bhajatye`katvamaasthitah,
Sarvathaa vartamaanopi say ogee mayi vartate`.
(6. 31)
(A person who is established in only the feeling of worshipping
Me, the Sacchidananda Vasudev as the Atma abiding in all
beings, always moves in Me, whatever he does.)
That is why yajgnyaatvaamritamashnute` (they obtain the amrita
that bestows immortality when they obtain this Gnan. By
obtaining this Gnan, they automatically obtain amrita.) What great
heights the Gita uplifts us to! The Gita lifted up the person who
ate too much or too little, indulged in inappropriate sensual
pleasures, was engrossed in a variety of efforts, enslaved by his
senses, and helpless in the clutches of desires and anger. The Gita
not only lifts you up, she also gives the Gnan about the Brahman’s
non-dual essence.
It is an amazing fact that whenever the Shastras and Shrutis speak
about Sanyas, they describe a Sanyasi’s personal life as ‘yathaa
jaataroopadharah.’ That means, ‘just like a new-born baby’. In
the Shrauta-Smarta system, a Sanyasi should lead a solitary life.
This is the ultimate lifestyle of a paramahansa (enlightened
Master). The lifestyle of the Buddhists was in a sangha – a group.
Parks and monasteries were built for them. The reason for this is
that they had to face great hardships and dangers. Sanyasis were
unconcerned with the place, monastery or group. They accepted
these only after the advent of Buddhism.
The Gita gives a different point of view. The Gita does not
establish the solitary lifestyle of a wondering Monk. Some learned
people extract this meaning, and this viewpoint is also given in the
Gita. However what the Gita emphasizes upon is the extraordinary
sukha (happiness) that comes from asangataa (non-attachment)
can be present in the life of any person, whether he is a
190

## Page 191

Brahmachari, Grihastha, or Vanaprasthi. This is the goal of the
Gita.
The principle given in the Gita is not to withdraw into inactivity,
live in a cave, or wear saffron robes and eat begged food. Arjuna
had said that he would rather eat begged food than fight. The
extraordinary viewpoint given by the Gita is one that should be
adopted by a Sanyasi, Vanaprasthi, Grihastha and Brahmachari.
Instead of stressing on the external, the Gita stresses on the
internal, removing the impurities of the antahkaran (fourfold
mind). The Gita removed aasakti (attachment) and tried to create
anaasakti (non-attachment). Anasakti is not the Dharma (natural
righteousness) of any particular Ashram (stage of life) or varna
(social level). It is for all Ashrams and varnas. A person need not
wear the garb of a Sanyasi or have the sanskara and formal
renunciation of worldly comforts. He can lead the life of a
Grihastha and also get the sukha of Sanyas. Bhagwan Shri
Krishna has shown how the sukha of Sanyas can be brought into
your life. You can live at home with your family and wealth, and
also enjoy this sukha. This is why Shri Krishna has given us the
sermon of the Gita.
The Gita has given all three sanskaras of doshaapanayana
(removing faults), gunaadhaana (inculcating desirable qualities)
and heenaangapoorti (replacing what is missing). Through these
sanskaras, the Gita removes the abhinive`sha (identification with
the body). Dharma removes the subtle ego of being a separate
entity, and the detachment created by bhakti removes raaga-
dve`sha (attachments-aversions). Sharanaagati (taking refuge in
Bhagwan) and being established in the feeling that you are the
drashta removes asmitaa (pride). Gnan about the essence of the
Paramatma removes avidya (ignorance; nescience). This is how
all the flaws are removed, good qualities brought in, and the
feeling of lacking – caused by our feeling of being separate
individuals – is also removed. This is how the Gita has shown that
the Atma and the Paramatma are one.

Pravachan XIV
Equanimity in interaction.
Until now, I have told you about how the Gita takes us from yukta
(attached to what is right and proper, and to Bhagwan) aahaara-
vihaara (intake and pleasures), to yukte`ndriya (senses that are
yukta), yukta chitta (mental inclinations that are yukta), yukta
karma (actions that are yukta), yukta bhoga (indulgences that are
yukta), yukta vritti (mental tendencies that are yukta) and a yukta
condition. It also gives yukta Gnan and vignaana (applied Gnan)
that makes a person feel tripta (fully contented). All the yukta
factors are connected to the tvam padaartha (the ‘you’ factor in
‘Tat tvam asi = That, the Brahman, is you, the Atma’. This is the
ultimate statement of the Vedas.) Yoginnaam sarve`shaam
madgate`naantaraatmanaa.’ ‘Shraddhaavaan bhajate` yo maam
sa me` yuktatamo matah.’ The Gita made us yukta up to the
highest level she can carry us to.
‘Yadaa viniyatam chittam’ (6. 18) is also yukta.
‘Shaknoteehaiva yah sodhum’ (5. 23) is also yukta.
‘Gnaanavignaana triptaatmaa’ (6. 8) is also yukta.
‘Yuktaaseeta matparah’ (2. 61) is also yukta.
However, when our antahkaran (the fourfold mind) becomes one
with the Paramatma, we become yuktatama (a yukta of the highest
level). A yuktatara is greater than a yukta, and a yuktatam is the
greatest yukta. But, the yuktataa (state of being yukta) attained
through shraddhaa (faith) is not enough. An aparoksha
saakshaatkaara (direct personal experience) should establish the
oneness of the Atma and the Brahman. That is why Bhagwan
made this pledge in the seventh chapter.
Asanshayam samagram maam yathaa gnaasyasi tatshrunu.
(7. 1)
Gnaanam te`ham savignaanamidam vakshyaamyashe`shatah,
yajgnaatvaa ne`ha bhooyonyagnaatavyamavashishyate`.

(7. 2)
(O Partha! Listen to what I tell you about My magnificence, glory,
power, and other qualities. Know that I am the Atma of all.
For your sake I will speak about the Gnan and vignana of My
essence in detail. Once you know this, there is nothing more that
you need to know.)
‘I am telling you about a Gnan that gives you knowledge about
the totality. Once a person obtains this knowledge, he has no need
for any further knowledge.’ The Vedas have made the same
pledge. ‘Yasmin krite` mate` vignaate` sarvamidam kritam matam
vignaanam bhavati – once this is known, everything is known.’
Pay attention to the last point.
In general, there are five kinds of advaitavaada (opinions within
the principle of non-duality). One is the scientists who believe that
everything is gross matter. All modern scientists experiment in
laboratories to establish the basic element in all matter. They use
computers for their calculations, and a variety of instruments to
examine substances. They say that at the root of everything is
inanimate matter. Life springs from inanimate matter and ends in
inanimate matter. For example, life evolved on earth, but not on
the moon; or else it evolved and died out. For them, the
paramaartha satya vastu (supreme truth; the ultimate object) is
gross matter, and everything becomes gross matter once
consciousness leaves it. This is called ‘jada-advaita’ (non-dual
materialism). It is separate from the advaita of the Charvak
school.
(1) The Charvaks believe that there are four elements, but the
materialists believe that there is one inanimate substance. You can
say that the scientists of today have become the uncles of the
Charvaks – they believe that consciousness is created by the
combination of the four elements. Further, the development of
inanimate objects is considered to be progress in our lifestyle.
193

## Page 194

Does this keep the pledge of the Vedas, that knowledge about one
thing gives the knowledge about everything? No, it does not. Why
not?
‘This’ (gross matter), becoming ‘I’ (the Atma), is not ascertained
by seeing matter turn into consciousness. It is ascertained by ‘this’
(matter) turning into ‘this’ (the body). The second ‘this’ is another
version of the first ‘this’. The creation of ‘I’ has not been seen.
The fact is that the ‘I’ who sees ‘this’, sees the distortions in ‘this’
(the body) and how it changes, has not been known by obtaining
the knowledge about ‘this’. The pledge that one vignaana
(science) would give all vignanas is not fulfilled by accepting that
all gross matter is one.
(2) What am I to tell you? There is one separate school that
accepts a continuous fluctuation of mental inclinations. I include
this in what I told you about inanimate matter. In my view, they
are the same. There people believe that mental inclinations keep
changing endlessly. Moments exist in change, so these people
believe that thoughts change every moment. It is a different matter
whether changes occur in minutes, or whether minutes exist in the
mental state, but the chitta (mental inclination) that changes from
minute to minute is the sansaara (interactive world). Nothing is
static. Those who follow this school of thought are called the
‘kshanika vignaanavaadee bauddha’ (the Buddhists who believe
in the science of momentary existence). Theirs in an Advaita of
the chitta. This does not include ‘I’ (the Atma) either. Why not?
Because, unless we are still, we cannot obtain the knowledge
about the objects that change constantly.
(3) Thus, one kind is the jada-advaitavadi, and another kind is the
chitta-advaitavadi. Then, there are the shoonya advaitavaadee,
who say that shoonya (vacuum) is the only independent essence.
Consciousness is born in inanimate matter, and we become aware
of the inanimate. Consciousness and matter need each other to
establish themselves and each other. Everything is created in the
vacuum and dissolves in it. The essence of the vacuum does not
depend on inanimate matter and consciousness. Creation and
194

---

## Page 195

destruction are known only in the moment of their awareness.
Gross matter needs consciousness, and consciousness needs gross
matter to establish themselves and each other. Therefore, the only
independent non-dual essence is the vacuum in which these are
perceived. This is the principle of the shoonya-advaitavadis. Even
this is incapable of giving the vignana of everything through one
vignana, because shoonya is not something that can be
experienced. If shoonya could be experienced, it would be the
experience that would be established; not the shoonya. And, if it
cannot be experienced, it remains something that is imagined.
(4) There is a fourth Advaita – eeshvaraadvaitavaada. The
calculation of this is that if you see the world through instruments
and the senses, the gross matter will create Aham (the subtle ego
of being an individual). This becomes vaignaanik bhautikavaada
– the science of materialism. If you see the world through
shraddhaa (faith), it will appear that the Ishwara has created the
world. And if you analyze the creation of the world through your
present mental state, it will seem that the world has either been
created from shoonya or by vignana. Ishawara-advaitavaada says
that the jeeva-jagat (the beings in this world) have been created
by ‘That’ (the Ishwara). Very well; if ‘That’ is the creator of ‘I’
(pure consciousness) then it is something that ‘I’ can never know.
The ‘I’ can only believe it. Thus, shraddha-assisted thought
enables us to obtain the vignana of the Ishwara; and therefore, the
vignana of everything. When logic is applied, it seems that ‘I’ is
created from a vacuum or by vignana. When thinking is based on
instruments and sense organs, it establishes that consciousness
evolves from gross matter.
(5) Vedanta brings something unique for us – the vignana that
gives the vignana of everything. Take it to be a fact, that this is
not an experience obtained through instruments or calculations!
This is not a mental condition of Yoga that is experienced in a
Samadhi. Nor is it a diatribe of logical arguments. The Vedas
revealed a Gnan that was hereto unknown, that there is one
vignana that can give the vignana of everything, because that one
195

---

## Page 196

thing is everything there is. It is the only thing that exists. Vedanta
says that ‘This’ (all that is perceived) is created by ‘I’, and ‘That’
(the Ishwara) is also created by ‘I’. The Kashmiri Shaivas call this
‘svaatantryavaada’ (the total independence of the Atma). The
Vedantis, who believe in the Upanishads point of view, say that
there is neither utpatti (creation) nor pralay (dissolution). The ‘I’
is nirvikaara (not subject to change; deterioration). It is the
drashtaa (the one who sees) of time and space, and therefore, it is
never effected by them. The ‘I’ is one with the Parabrahma
Paramatma, since it is nirvikara; and since it is one, there is
nothing else. This is why it fulfills the pledge of one vignana
giving the vignana of all things. The person has the direct personal
experience that the Atma is the Brahman.
When we say that aham-idam (I-this) are created by the Ishwara,
it is based on shraddhaa (faith). When we say that they are
created by the chitta (state of mind), or inanimate matter, it is
based on vignana. It is based on scientific instruments,
intelligence, or experience. The Vedanta vignana gives the
knowledge through a different method. The knowledge it reveals
is that of a non-dual, unknown object, through ‘Tat tvam asi’ (Tat
= that, the Brahman, asi = is tvam = you). ‘Aham brahmaasmi’
(aham = I, the Atma, asi = is, brham = the Brahman).
‘Ayamaatmaa brahm’ (ayam = this Atma, brahm = is the
Brahman). And, ‘pragnaanam brahm’ (pure Gnan is the
Brahman). I told you about this yesterday.
Place the pratyaksha (that which is known by the senses) in the
middle and use it to discriminate between its kaarana (cause) and
drashtaa (the one who sees). For example, this clock has gold in
the center. If you want to discriminate the consciousness that
made it, you will have to know that there is an important metal
called gold that is separate from the clock. You will have to know
that the gold is che`tan (pure consciousness). Similarly, this
interactive world is like a clock, and the Ishwara is the abhinna-
nimittopaadaana kaarana. He is the cause that is not separate
from the matter. Do bhakti of the Ishwara; meaning, do vi-bhakti
196

---

## Page 197

(separate the two; discriminate). Separate them and know the
Parameshwara. That is bhakti! And, separate yourself from the
clock of the world – do vibhakti between the clock and yourself.
‘I see the clock. I know the clock.’ This bhakti is vive`ka
(discrimination). The fact is that separating the Ishwara from the
pratyaksha is bhakti, and separating the Atma from the pratyaksha
is called vivek. Or, the Paramatma who is established by bhakti,
and the world in which you use vivek, are the same. To reveal this
is the purpose of the Vedanta Shastra. The Atma is separate from
the perceived world, and so is the Paramatma. The Atma and
Paramatma are one, and the sattaa (the truth that cannot be
negated) of the pratyaksha is negated. The perceived world is
negated by its absence in the adhishthaana (substratum). Now, we
will see how we are to proceed on the path of the Gita.
If you wish to obtain the Gnan of the ananta (infinite), you will
have to shift your attention from all big and small worldly matters.
Shifting your attention does not mean that you are no longer
aware of them. It means that you do not consider them to be so
important that you get involved in them and forget the more
important matters. We have become so enslaved that our attention
never shifts from these petty matters. We constantly think about
what people eat, drink, and wear! My brother, are you their
guardian, judge, or advocate? What are you?
We should go on our own path. It is true that at times we have no
option but to do something we know to be not right but that is
only until we become independent. After that, we can refuse
outright to succumb to any pressure. At present, we are helpless
before our indriya (senses) and mind. Our mind and our senses
compel us – the pure consciousness, the sakshee [witness], the
Atma, the part of the Brahman – into doing what they dictate! The
day you become free of them, you will refuse to comply with their
demands. So, see where the Gita lifts you up from. The Gita says
that the first thing is that you must know the method of right
living.

Sukha-dukhe` same` kritvaa laabhaalaabhau jayaajayau,

( 2.38)
(Consider happiness and sorrow, victory and defeat, gain and loss,
to be the same, and get ready for battle. Then, you will not incur
sin.)
In life, at times we win and at times we lose. At times we get what
we want and at times we don’t. Things can go the way we want,
or go against us. These three dualities come before us. You will be
defeated at some point, and emerge the victor at some point. You
have to realize that you can’t win all the time. We all have to face
loss or defeat some time. A person who expects to never lose,
suffers greatly when he loses, and when he wins, it goes to his
head.
When I was coming to Vrindavan this time, we got a newspaper at
the Ratlam Station. It was published from Madhya Pradesh. It
reported that one party stated, ‘Our party is sure to win next time,
because the party that won these elections is filled with vanity.
They will become arrogant and neglect their duties to the public.
We are alert and working hard, so we are sure to win next time.’
I showed this to Dada, and told him, ‘If the other party reads this,
they will be warned. They will be careful, and defeat this party
again.’ Therefore, when we achieve something, we tend to be
pramaadee (forgetful of our obligations), and when we lose, we
feel glaani (disgust). Both pramada and glani are faults of the
antahkaran (fourfold mind). What we have to do is consider
victory and defeat as the sides of the wheels of a chariot that come
up turn by turn. We should face both with equanimity.
Sukhadukhe` same` kritvaa jayaa jayau same` kritvaa,

In business there are times when you make a loss and there are
times when you make a profit. People have to sell off goods at
reduced rates to win back the confidence of their customers. Later,
they gain from the patronage. I know that people make business
projects with a calculation of a substantial loss in the first year, a
smaller loss in the second year, and a break-even in the third year,
and then they start making a profit. It is not so easy to succeed in
business. People have to face losses as well as profits.
I was told by a businessman, ‘Maharaj, there are two basic factors
in doing business successfully. One is that the quality of the
product should not deteriorate. We should not try to cheat our
customers by supplying sub-standard products. The other factor is
to win the confidence of our customers.’
The same principle applies to spiritual discourses. When
preachers use frivolous stories or dirty examples to attract an
audience, their popularity does not endure. People say that they
substance of their talk is not superior. Our quality should always
remain good. Then, the customers recognize the merit.
Now, see the second factor in business. If you advertise that in
case anyone is dissatisfied with your product, they can return it
and claim a refund, it will create confidence that there is no
chance of anyone being cheated, and people will buy your product
unhesitatingly. You may, at most, have one or two items returned,
but the majority of people will retain what they have selected.
Making a profit is not everything; we have to give as well as get
benefits. Getting benefits and giving benefits are two sides of the
same coin.
The Gita says, ‘If you have a loss and someone else gains, you
should think that you have made a gain in the form of the other
person, because the Atma in both is one.’ Laabhaalaabhau
jayaajayau. And see where the Gita takes you up to – jayaajayau!
It takes you to the battlefield where arrows rain on all sides, yet
you don’t lose your equanimity.
Laabhaalabhau – you don’t lose your equanimity even in
business, whether you make a profit or a loss. You retain your
199

## Page 200

equanimity in hot and cold weather. There is no need to grumble
about the weather; your grumbles will not change the weather!
Little children start crying when the day ends, because they fear
the dark. Then they fall asleep and when they wake up it is

happiness and sorrow with equipoise). You must retain mental
balance whether things are to your liking or not.
Sheetoshnasukhadukhe`shu samah sangavivarjitah.
(12. 18)
(A bhakta’s serenity remains undisturbed in heat and cold, sukha
and dukha. He is free of being attached to anything.)
The Gita teaches you how to live. This life is everlasting. It is
called saadhanaa (effort for spiritual progress). At times, I am
amused to see people go to hill-stations during the summer, and to
warm places during the winter. My friend, tolerate the hot and
cold weather where you are. You will develop samataa
(equipoise). For example, if it turns cold in Mumbai, think that the
chill of Kashmir has come to your home. You don’t derive
pleasure because the cold has come on its own. You fail to enjoy
the warmth of summer. In December-January, you want the
weather of June-July, and in June-July you want the weather of
December-January! You want to create changes in time. If you
tolerate the weather, you will see how good it is for your health.
Don’t try to develop equanimity in the climate – develop
equanimity in your body. This is called ‘sadhana.’
There was a venerated Mahatma who is no more; I will even tell
you his name. If any of his disciples are present, I ask for their
forgiveness. He lived at Gangotri. His name was Shri
Krishnashramji Maharaj. Many of you would have heard of him.
He lived naked in the extreme cold of Gangotri for thirty or forty
years. He used no covering whatsoever, while we needed four
blankets to keep out the chill!

Malviyaji had once invited Shri Krishnashramji to inaugurate a
Vishva Vidyalaya at Haridwar, so he came down. It was the lunar
month of Magh (December), when we needed at least two quilts
to keep warm. Shri Krishnashramji was sweating so profusely that
people had to fan him! ‘Sheetoshnasukhadukhe`shu samah’ –
retain equanimity in the dualities of heat and cold, joy and sorrow.
Shri Krishnashramji was unable to bear the ‘heat’ of Haridwar and
wanted to return at once to Gangotri. He was used to the extreme
cold. He was not accustomed to the comparatively higher
temperature of Haridwar. This is not in keeping with the Gita’s
way of life. The Gita tells us to tolerate the heat of summer and
the chill of winter, retaining metal equilibrium in both. Just as day
and night follow each other, and we accept them, so do cold and
warmth, joy and sorrow, profit and loss, victory and defeat. They
are the same. Don’t let them upset your mental balance. The life
of a sadhak (spiritual seeker) is a life of equipoise. To remain
mentally balanced means a natural lifestyle.
This ‘I’ (the Atma) of ours is avinaashee (indestructible; eternal),
and therefore, our life cannot be such that we always win and
never lose. Nor is it possible to always lose and never win. It is
not possible that we continue to make profits and never make a
loss; or that we face only losses and never make a profit. In life
we have to see both. We should have the habit of facing reverses
as well as favorable situations, without losing our equilibrium.
Now I will ask you what you would do if you see a good man and
a bad man. The Gita tells you that in this life you will meet both
paapee (sinners) and punyaatmaa (people who do good deeds). If
you become depressed at seeing a paapi and elated at the sight of
a punyatma, you will never experience the extraordinary
joyfulness of jeevan mukti (being liberated from worldly
concerns). What the Gita describes is the joyous abandon of being
completely carefree.
Suhrinmitraaryudaaseena - madhyasthadve`shyabandhushu,
saadhushvapi cha paape`shu samabuddhirvishishyate`.

(6.9)
(A person who has equal goodwill towards a well-wisher, friend,
enemy, an indifferent person, a neutral person, a person filled with
hatred, for pious people and sinners, is truly great.)
Now have you understood? ‘Saadhusvapi cha paapeshu.’ You
want to walk in crowded areas, but encounter only well-dressed
people. You want to avoid mendicants and people whose clothes
are not clean. You want to go to a popular beach like Chowpatty,
and think that you will see no old fashioned ladies, or see only old
fashioned ladies who cover their heads. Well, my brother, when
you go to any crowded public place you will see all kinds of
people. You will see ladies dressed traditionally with their heads
covered, and you will see modern ladies with uncovered heads.
You will see ugly people and good looking people. You may
encounter a pickpocket and a philanthropist who feeds beggars.
Unless you try to retain a mental equanimity, the joy of your
essence is sure to become fragmented. You must ensure that your
serenity is not disturbed. If you meet a Mahatma, greet him with
folded hands. And, what if you meet a crook? Greet him with
folded hands also. Don’t let your heart turn bitter. This is what the
Gita teaches you.
I had attended a conference organized by the Bharat Sadhu Samaj.
I met the Brahmin leaders one day, and Raidasis (followers of
Saint Raidas, who was a cobbler) another day. The Bharat Sadhu
Samaj has all the different groups. Anyone who becomes a Sadhu
(Monk), or is a follower of a sect started by a Guru, can become a
Member.
Now, what happened is that the Dandi Swamis came, and
Acharyaji Maharaj Ayengarji also came. The Pingal and Bargal
came, and so did the disciples of the Saraswati, Tirtha, and
Ashram groups. Among them were the Kabir Panthis, Raidasis,
and Dadu Dayalis. Had anyone shown any reservation for any
other group, would the Sadhu Samaj have continued, or would it

have been ruined? Our society is the same. There are all kinds of
people in it. How can it continue? The Gita says –
Vidyaavinayasampanne` braahmane` gavi hastini,
shuni chaiva shvapaake` cha panditaah samadarshinih.
(5.18)
(People who have obtained Gnan have equal goodwill for a
learned Brahmin who has humility, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and
a Chandal of the lowest caste.)
No matter who you look at, you should not look askance, and your
intellect should not be flawed. This is the Gita’s saadhan
(method). It is not an ordinary or nominal matter; it is what is
called saadhan (effort for spiritual progress). This is called
bhaagvatdharma (the Dharma given by Bhagwan).
Brahmane` pulkase` ste`ne` brahmanye`rke` sfulingake`,
akroore` kroorake` chaiva samadrik pandito matah.
(Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapurana 11. 29. 14)
You want your shop to flourish. If you put up a Notice that says
that only Brahmins can enter; non-Brahmins are not allowed, how
can your shop flourish? And then, how will you recognize the
caste of your customers? Is it possible for the eyes to see only
Brahmins and no others? The eyes see a human being; they don’t
see the caste of the person. Someone may say that he will install
an automatic strip, but no strip will work, since it can only show a
human. It is essential that you have equanimity for everybody,
regardless of their caste. Otherwise, your emotions will fluctuate
several times a day. Your mind will swing between tranquility and
agitation. You will be gladdened and saddened repeatedly.
We must progress, regardless of what we see. The very faults that
anger us come into us at times. There are times when a book we
revere falls from our hands. Is this not akaushal (maladroitness)?
Quite often, I find that the vest I am wearing is turned inside out. I
203

## Page 204

did not notice it when I put it on. I have often bitten by own
tongue – should I pick up a stone and break my teeth?
My brother, look at your essence. Just see how vast you are! This
is what the Gita points out. The Gita doesn’t just advise the
Brahmins about what they should do. Now is the Gita’s message
only for Kshatriyas (the warrior class), Vaishyas (traders and
farmers), or Shudras (labor class). The Gita’s advice is for all
human beings. The Smritis for the Dharma for all Varnas (classes)
are separate. The Gita is the Smriti of the Dharma that is common
to all.
Tell me; haven’t you ever made a mistake while working? Have
you never added too much salt in the vegetables you cooked? Has
the dal never got burnt, or the rice left undercooked? What is this?
This is akaushal in work. It is clumsy work. Clumsiness is always
present in our life; what can you do? Will you cut off your hand?
Na dveshtyakushalam karma kushale` naanushajjate`,
tyaagee satvasamaavishto me`dhaavee chhinnasanshayah.
(18.10)
(A person who has no hatred for clumsy action, and does not get
attached to skillful work, is attached to pure Sattva guna and is
free of doubts, is intelligent, and a true renunciate.)
See how highly the Gita praises you! You may have made a
mistake at some point, stumbled while walking, and got hurt
because you were not alert. Or, you may have accidentally
brushed against wet paint and felt angry with yourself. Or else,
supposing there is no akaushal in you – you are always alert and
adroit. When a person is very good at something, he tends to
acquire some vanity, and clumsiness brings shame. The Gita tells
you not to let your life be burnt by vanity or shame. Don’t
deliberately harden your life. Don’t let it flow away like water or
burn away like fire, or drift away like the wind.
Make your life such that it has the firmness of the earth, the
sweetness of water, the burning capacity of fire, the movement of
204

## Page 205

the wind, and the vastness of space. Ask the Shri Krishna of the
Gita what your life should be like.
Tyaagee sattvasamaavishtah me`dhaavee chhinnasanshayah.
1. Tyaagee – give up worldly considerations.
2. Sattva samaavishta – remain established in your Atma.
3. Me`dhaavee – continue to learn.
Medhavi means to continue to learn new things. You would be
knowing that there are many synonyms for buddhi (the intellect)
in Sanskrit. Medhavi is one of them. Me`dhaa means to go on
enhancing knowledge. ‘Dhee dhaaranaavatee me`dhaa’ –
Amarkosha. Our dhee (intellect) should be dhaaranaavatee
capable of learning something from everything. If you wish to
achieve success in your life, don’t harbor doubts.
4. Chhinnasanshayah – cut away doubts.
Continue to learn, be established in your Atma, and accept
whatever happens in the world. The sun sets; it is all right. The
sun rises; it is all right. The day comes; it is all right. The night
comes; it is all right. Whenever you form worldly attachments,
and want things to be to your liking, your aagraha (urge for
something) will become a duraagraha (a harmful urge). Stop
wanting the things that are subject to change, to remain
unchanged. Your agraha will become your parigraha
(accumulation). In astrology, the paapa graha (the planet that
indicates a tendency to sin) brings misfortune to the person.
Duraagraha also brings sorrow. You may not be aware of this
point in astrology, that the eleventh house in a person’s horoscope
is the planet that gives good fortune. However, when Shani
(Saturn) comes over it, it does not bring bad luck; it brings good
fortune. Logically, Saturn should being misfortune when it rules
the position of good luck. It should create an obstacle for good
fortune; but this is not what happens.
Very well; I will tell you something more about Shanishchara
(Saturn). The sixth position is the position of the enemy, but when
205

---

## Page 206

Shani comes into this position, it does not strengthen the enemy; it
weakens the enemy.
Thus, there are times when the paapagraha brings some benefits,
as you are sure to know if you believe in consulting astrologers. I
do not tell you this to urge you to consult astrologers. What I wish
to tell you is that even the sangraha (accumulations) in your life
are grahas (planets that influence your life). Your parigraha,
aagraha, and vigraha (physical form) are all grahas. They are
mental grahas. You may use your vive`ka (discrimination) to
understand how many of these are papa-grahas and how many are
punya graha (planets that promote good deeds). However, the
grahas in space cause less suffering than the grahas of the chitta
(mental inclinations).
And, do you know how these can be quieted? To neutralize the ill-
effects of the celestial grahas, people give lentils and black cloth
to Brahmins. It is said that is the Shanishchara is very strong, you
can donate a black buffalo. Some people donate a black umbrella,
or anything made of iron. However, for the grahas of the mind,
Satsang (spiritual discourses) is the only solution. Until you take
refuge in Mother Gita, you won’t succeed in quieting the grahas in
your mind.
You see, the graha of vishamataa (disbalance) has settled in your
mind. Come, I will tell you a method by which you can gain
victory over the whole world. Learn from the Gita. The Gita
wants you to conquer the world. Won’t you conquer the world if
you become a sthitapragya? ‘Dukhe`shvanudvignamanaa
sukhe`shu vigatasprihah’ (a sthitapragya is not distressed when
sorrow comes; nor does he long for joy to continue). Won’t your
retain your balance of mind if you achieve this? This is called
‘samataa’ – equanimity – isn’t it? Won’t you be
‘samadukhasukha’ if you are a bhakta?
Adve`shtaa sarvabhootaanaam maitrah karuna e`va cha,
nirmamo nirahankaara samadukhasukhah kshamee.
(12. 13)

## Page 207

(One who has no hatred for any being, is not selfish, has affection
for all, in naturally kind hearted, free of partiality and pride, is
forgiving, and remains equal in joy and sorrow is dear to Me.)
What will you be, if you are gunaateeta (beyond the influence of
the three tendencies that fluctuate and influence your actions)?
Won’t you be samadukhasukha (equipoised in joy and sorrow)?
The characteristics of a gunateeta are:
Samadukhasukhah svasthah samaloshtaashmakaanchanah,
tulyapriyaapriyo dheerastulyanindaatmasanstutih.
(14. 24)
(One who is always established in his Atma, is equal towards
sorrow and joy, is equally indifferent to clay, stone and gold, has
Gnan, accepts the peasant and unpleasant with equanimity, and
considers criticism and praise to be the same.)
Do you wish to be a gunateeta? Do you want to be a sthitapragya
(a person who is established in his Atma)? Do you want to be a
bhakta? Then you will have to be equipoised in sorrow and joy.
My brother, a river flows; the water is murky at times. A flower
floats in it, or a corpse. Time flows. There are stormy times and
happy times. The earth flows. The road can be bumpy or dirty.
Don’t you come across garbage when you walk? This is how you
have to go ahead in life. The Gita teaches you how to win over the
world.
Ihaiva tairjatih sargo ye`shaam saamye` sthitm manah,
nirdosham hi samam brahma tasmaadbrahmani te` sthitaah.
(5. 19)
(He, whose mind is perfectly balanced, has conquered the world
in this very life, because the flawless Sacchidananda Paramatma is
pristine and balanced, and the person is thus established in the
Sacchidananda Paramatma.)
207

## Page 208

We have now come to the Brahman in interaction. He is called –
‘Ihaiva tairjitah sargo ye`shaam saamye` sthitam manah’- he,
whose mind is always balanced. The world can do nothing to
harm him. The world cannot create raaga-dve`sha (attachments-
aversions) in his mind. It cannot create abhinive`sha
(identification with the body; fear of death). The world cannot
create asmitaa (pride). Avidyaa (nescience) can never touch him.
Touch whom?
‘Ye`shaam saamye` sthitam manah’ – one whose mind is perfectly
balanced.
How does one who has equipoise be said to have conquered the
world?
‘Nardosham hi samam brahm’. Samata (equanimity) is the
Brahman, and the Brahman is flawless. The Brahman is the only
flawless thing in existence. So, only a person who is established in
samata, remains moved by dualities like heat-cold, mine-
another’s, favorable-unfavorable, profit-loss, victory-defeat,
sorrow-joy, etc, can live like a tiger. Only such a person can lead a
life of fulfillment. People who dream of specific circumstances
that will bring happiness are poor indeed! They think that they can
be happy only if they have the whole world in their clutches.
Happiness is not obtained by holding on; you can be happy only if
you let go. So, let go of your sorrow and the things that bring
sorrow. It is so simple!

Pravachan XV.
Don’t do Atma-hinsa (self-destruction).
Just a few days back, a famous German scientist had come to
Delhi. He was no ordinary scientist; he was world famous, and he
was an elderly man.
This scientist came to Delhi and said he wanted to meet a Sanskrit
scholar. A meeting was arranged, and they spoke at length. Our
Indian scholar asked the German scientist, ‘How is it that a world
famous scientist like you – who is in such a high position – had
the wish to meet a Sanskrit scholar?’
The German explained that he was involved in research during the
World War. Bombing started, and he told the girl he was working
with, that they should shelter in a bunker incase a bomb fell on the
building. ‘Why do you fear death so much?’ she asked. ‘I am not
afraid of death. Death is like going to sleep. The Atma never dies.
No bomb can destroy the Atma.’
Intrigued, the scientist asked the girl how she knew this. She
replied that she read the Bhagwat Gita. She showed him where it
was written that the Atma is not born and does not die. She was
convinced that what the Gita said was true.
The scientist was astonished that an ordinary girl could be so
fearless in face of death, while he – a prominent scientist – feared
it so much. He told the Sanskrit scholar about how he began to
read the Gita and study other Sanskrit works. The result was a
wish to go to India some day, and meet some people learned in
Sanskrit.
You must have understood what I am trying to say. The Shrimad
Bhagwat Mahapurana describes dreams as a play of maayaa
(illusion), and describes deep sleep as mrityu (death). You have no
fear of sleep because you have the faith that you will wake up
again and find your world as it is; whereas, you have doubts about
whether you will wake up after death or not. Nor do you know
what kind of a world you may find yourself in when you awaken.
209

## Page 210

People feel distressed at the thought of leaving all they love
behind. The sorrow is not about death. It is fear, because you
don’t know what will happen, and that you will lose your loved
people and possessions. Whereas when you sleep, you are
confident that you will wake up refreshed and continue with your
normal life.
This adhyaatma vidyaa (metaphysical knowledge) teaches you
that just as your tendencies return when you awaken from your
sleep, you get the same state of mind that you had when you died
when you are reborn. Be fully assured about this. Have no more
doubts on this score.
Can you calculate how many times you would go to sleep and
wake up again, if you lived for a hundred years? A year has 365
days. If you sleep just once a day, you would sleep and wake up
36500 times in a hundred years.
Your lifespan is not 100 years; it is infinite. It has no beginning
and no end, because it is not possible for anybody to experience
their genesis or destruction. That means this life exists in-between
the anaadee (that, which has no beginning) and the ananta (that,
which has no end). Therefore, death is less important than your
going to sleep and waking up. The smaller gets lost in the greater.
For example, your glass of milk has some value, whether it is a
small glass or a large tumbler. But, will this milk have any value
after you pour it into the Gangaji or the sea? The milk will then
have no independent weight or volume.
In the same way, when your life becomes one with eternity, birth
and death lose their value. You consider birth and death to be
important because you believe your weight to be like the glass of
milk. The fact is that nothing can be measured in the infinite. You
know this, because you know how things are measured. Tell me,
what percentage of eternity would a hundred years be? What
portion of space would a few feet’s height be? And, what
percentage would your weight be, in infinite matter? So, birth and
death have value only when you consider yourself limited to
certain parameters.

You see that I am seated higher than you, but lower than the
ceiling. However, where would you say I was seated, if there was
no ground beneath and no ceiling above? Would I be higher or
lower? High and low are comparative, depending on other factors.
I am sitting to Prabuddhanand’s east, and to the west of Dada.
But, if nobody was beside me, there would be no east or west to
describe my position. So, tell me, where is your body in the
Creation of the Paramatma?
I place another point before you now. See your body from the
viewpoint of eternal life. Don’t get so caught up in the
preoccupations of this body that you lose sight of the infinite
quality of your existence. Otherwise, you will become whoever
you merge your ‘I’ into.
What is it that you want?
I want a diamond. I want an inanimate object.
When you desire a diamond, your mental inclination will take on
the form of a diamond, and you will become inanimate. When you
want a human being, your mind will assume the form of a human
being. And, if you want the Ishwara, your mind will take on the
form of the Ishwara, and you will become the Ishwara. And what
if there is nothing and no one you desire? Then you will
experience the summit of your own independence. This is what is
called moksha (liberation).
Nairape`kshyam param praahurnishre`yasamanalpakam,
tasmaanniraashisho bhaktirnirape`kshasya me` bhave`t.
(Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapurana 11. 20. 35)
When you, yourself sit with no expectations whatsoever, your
sattaa (pure existence) will be nirape`ksha (free of expectations),
your Gnan will be nirapeksha, and your ananda will be
nirapeksha. You will experience the peak of your independence.
But, you make yourself heena (lacking, impoverished). You knife
yourself, cut yourself up with a sword, and shoot yourself with a
gun! When?
When you allow yourself to feel inferior.

Na hinsti aatmanaatmaanam tato yaati paraam gatim.
(13. 28)
(The person who does not destroy himself obtains the supreme
state.)
Don’t deliberately destroy yourself. Aatmanaa aatmaanam na
hinasti tatah paraam gatim yaati. Don’t cut yourself up. Don’t
harm yourself.
Very well; I will tell you something first. We hear a great deal
about anubhava-anubhava-anubhava (metaphysical experiences)!
I have also spent many months, many years, in this maze. What,
after all, is anubhav? For villagers, it is a great bugbear, to
frighten children with. People say, ‘He has had great experiences.’
There are Sadhus who smoke opium pipes. The one whose smoke
rises highest is considered to have the greatest experiences. The
experience of these Sadhus is that nothing can be achieved by
studying the Vedas or doing the maalaa (rosary). They say that a
person becomes free of desire by smoking opium. However, this
is their experience. They alone know how true it is!
I met a man who drank bhaanga (an herbal drink that causes
hallucinations). He was not from Mathura, Varanasi, or Prayag; he
came from some village. He said, ‘You people keep taking the
name of the Ishwara-Ishwara, Swarga-Swarga (Heaven),
Vaikuntha-Vaikuntha (the abode of Vishnu Bhagwan)! You long
for these. Come; try a little bhaanga-bhavaani (goddess bhang).
You will instantly go to Swarga. You will go to Vaikuntha and
Goloka (the abode of Bhagwan Shri Krishna).’ This is the
experience of a person who drinks bhaang.
I do not say this to praise or criticize hallucinogenic substances. I
say this to warn you that if someone comes to you and says, ‘I
have had this experience,’ make sure of the caliber of the
experience. Don’t get mesmerized by what people say. See the
level of the person’s anubhav. There are parameters even
regarding metaphysical experiences. Some people are experts on
212

---

## Page 213

the Constitution, and some are experts on International Law.
Similarly, there is a Constitution about metaphysical experiences.
You may believe it or not, but I am also an expert on the
Constitution of anubhav! Experiences are evaluated. They are
weighed and considered. Is the value of this experience a few
grams or is it one ton? Experiences have characteristics. The
experience of little worth is different and the experience of
something truly great is different. There are books of rules about
anubhav. It is not that anyone can take law into his own hands.
Had that been the case, there would be any number of people
going around claiming to have had wonderful, supernatural
experiences!
A person gains power over a Yakshini (an invisible, supernatural
being, a female). She comes and whispers in his ear, telling him
where you went and what you did before going to him. She cannot
tell what you will do when you leave. Isn’t that one grade of
anubhav?
Somebody tells you, ‘You will die tomorrow.’
‘What should I do, Maharaj, to save myself?’
‘Give me a monetary gift. I will have your death put off.’
This is called thug-vidyaa. It is a trick to cheat others.
One experience is that of a Yakshini. Another is the experience of
losing awareness. This can be done by taking a pill, pressing a
certain nerve, doing praanaayaama (Yogic breath control
exercises), or hypnotism. But, is this the experience of the
Paramartha (supreme state)? It is not; it is a magic show. It is a
third grade experience.
The samvidhaana (Constitution; rules) of the anubhav of the
Paramartha is when multiplicity dissolves and becomes one
essence. The state where everything merges into itself is a second
grade experience. The grade one experience is when nothing
remains – no space, time or matter – your Self is the Paramatma.
This is the Constitution of anubhav. This is what is meant by the
statement of the Vedas, that the knowledge of all vignaana
applied science) can be obtained through one vignana. This is how
213

---

## Page 214

ne`ti-ne`ti (‘not this - not this’, negating everything until only the
Atma/Brahman remains). This is how you can understand the
mahaa vaakya (ultimate statement) of the Vedas, like
‘Tattvamasi’ (You are That, the Brahman) and ‘Ahambrahmaasi’
(I am the Brahman). Anubhav ends in adviteeyataa (non-duality;
oneness). Anubhav is incomplete until you experience your non-
dual essence.
E`ktaa (oneness) is the figure that is inclusive and is a fragment.
For example, the figure one is separate from all other figures, but
is included in them. ‘E`ti iti’ means, one is there, but it is not
adviteeya (non-dual). Meaning, it does not make a figure. One
plus one makes two. One plus one plus one makes three. One
divided by two – these are called ‘sankyaa’ – numbers. Figures
can be divided or multiplied. In the adviteeya vastu (the non-dual
object, the Brahman, the Atma) there is no expansion or
reduction. Advitya-advitiya does not make two. Advitiya cannot
be multiplied. The feeling of oneness contains expansion and
constriction, but there is no change in the experience of the non-
dual. The experience of oneness can be broken and attached, but
the experience of non-duality cannot, because it is the shuddha
vastu – the pristine object.
So, the rule of anubhav is advitiya, and – advitiya of what? Not
the advitiya of ‘this’ (gross matter). ‘This’ can never be non-dual,
because ‘this’ will always be separate from ‘I’. ‘That’ cannot be
advitiya either, since ‘I’ will be separate from ‘that’. It is only in
non-duality that ‘I’ can experience being non-dual.
The Vedas are the constitution of non-duality. The constitution of
anubhav is the Upanishads. Unless and until anubhav is tested on
the touchstone of the Upanishads, Gita, and the Vedas, it s not
considered authentic, no matter how many fellows boast of the
great experiences they have had. Is your anubhav complete
according to the constitution or not? This is what needs to be
examined. Come; let us return to the Gita.
Samam pashyanhi sarvatra samavasthitameeshvaram,

na hinastyaatmanaatmaanam tato yati paraam gatim.
(13. 28)
(He, who sees all beings as equal because the Paramatma is
established in them all, does not destroy himself, and therefore,
attains the supreme state.)
The Paramatma is sama (equal, balanced). Sama means He is in
all, and in everything. He is present in birth and in death. It is not
that there is a separate Ishwara at night and another in the day. It
is not that there is one Ishwara for a poor man and another for a
rich man; or one for fools and another for the learned. It is not that
one Ishwara abides in a Hindu and another in a Muslim, Russian
or German. The Gita tells us to see the Ishwara equally in all.
Samam pashyanhi sarvatra samavasthitameeshvaram.
It is different with political leaders! In their case, there will be one
Ishwara in Maharashtra, another in Gujarat and a third in
Karnataka. The reason is that there will be three Chief Ministers
and three Education Ministers. For those who have no
Government positions, however, the Ishwara in Maharashtra,
Mysore and Gujarat is the same. They are all in the same country.
Is it not so? Therefore, Narayana, it is when the focus is on the
One that the mind becomes free of raaga-dve`sha (attachments-
aversions).
Samam pashyan hi sarvatra samavsthitameeshvaram.
In the Shrimad Bhagwat there is a mention about the crabs that
crawl, the birds that fly, the lice that grow on bodies and the
insects that sting. ‘See them as your sons – aatmanah putravat
pashye`t.’ Just as a son is created from a drop of your body fluid,
lice are created from your perspiration. What is the difference?
Oh, Bhagwan! A Seth read this once. ‘What a comparison!’ he
exclaimed. ‘Where is my son and what is a worthless lice?’

Narayana! People enmeshed in moha (delusion) and mamataa
(possessive attachment) favor their own, causing harm to others.
They cannot accept this magnanimous outlook. They lack the
capacity to ‘samam pashyanhi sarvatra – see everything with
equal goodwill.’
Your heart is tied outside. If your heart is not within, it will be
bound to some external object. Then, how can you have even a
glimpse of shaanti (peace)? The Gita brings the knowledge of
shanti, and gives shanti even in worldly interaction. The Gita has
not come to ascertain the Varna Dharma (the Dharma for the four
social classes), or Ashram Dharma (the Dharma for the four
stages of life). The Gita establishes maanav dharma – the Dharma
for every human being. The Dharma of Varnas like the Brahmin,
and Ashramas like Brahmacharya (celibate student), are merely
indicated in half a couplet or less. We have to gauge the rest by
referring to other scriptures. The Gita is for all human beings,
because it is the speech of Bhagwan, and what Bhagwan says is
for the good of all.
Whenever Bhagwan speaks, He has the good of the whole world
in mind. This is the characteristic of Bhagwan’s speech. This is
how His words are recognized as His. He tells everybody, ‘Look,
My brother, don’t consider yourself to be inferior – na
hinasyaatmaanam’. When do you feel impoverished? It is when
you think that you lack something others have. Oh – is that item
of greater importance than yourself? You are a part of the
Paramatma. You are His essence – yet you feel small! It is
because you give so much importance to worldly possessions that
you feel inferior or lacking.
‘Na hinastyaatmanaatmaanam,’ says Bhagwan. A man may feel
inferior because he does not get some worldly indulgence, or a
particular type of apparel. One Seth became very sad one day.
Why? He had a car that cost 10,000 rupees. In earlier days, a
Hindustan Ambassador car cost Rs.10,000. He took me in his car,
and began to weep.
‘My brother, why are you weeping?’ I asked.
216

## Page 217

‘Maharaj,’ he replied, ‘I used to be a wealthy man. Had I
remained as well off as before, I would today be taking you in a
car worth 1 lakh! It is my misfortune that I have to take you in a
car worth 10,000.’
Now, see this! He was using a car worth 10,000 rupees, taking me
with him, and also weeping! Is the car of greater importance or
am I? You have reduced your own value to such an extent that
you start weeping if you don’t have a matching blouse or slippers!
Women get upset if they don’t have matching accessories.
Fashions keep changing. Loose clothes are in fashion one day, and
tight ones in fashion the next day. Young ladies ask, ‘How can I
go anywhere if I don’t have the latest kinds of clothes?’ Is it not
so? Oh – is there no inherent beauty in you? Don’t your eyes
shine? Doesn’t your face glow? You fail to value these, and value
only the apparel. This is called a feeling of being small.
I am not speaking only about clothes or young ladies. I am talking
about adults and elderly people. The venerable people sitting here
tell me that they don’t have a large house, a big car, or some
special kind of clothes, and this is why they feel inferior to those
who have them. Don’t cut yourself up. The Ishwara is
everywhere. See Him in your birth and in your death, in your
poverty and wealth, at home and outside, in your own people and
in others. Have His darshan (see with reverence) everywhere.
‘Samam pashyanhi sarvatra’ – this is Bhagwan’s speech. He has
said that He is present equally in the rich and the poor, fools and
the learned, the naked and the well-dressed. Bhagwan is telling
you that you should pass you life taking the dualities like heat and
cold, sorrow and joy, etc in your stride.
Maatraasparshaastu kaunte`ya sheetoshnasukhadukhadaah,
aagamaapaayinonityaastaanstitikshasva bhaaratah.

experiencing heat-cold, sorrow-joy. These feelings rise up and die

down. They are temporary, so you should endure them with
equanimity.)
Oh, they come and they go; they are fleeting. You neither come
nor go; you are everlasting. So, let the fleeting flow on. They can
do you no harm. Don’t be afraid. Don’t destroy yourself. Think of
the lives of our sages who had obtained the knowledge of the
Brahman. There is one kind of life lead by the ordinary people,
and one kind of life lead by the brahma-ve`ttaa (those who know
the Brahman). I had told you yesterday – or the day before – that
when a learned Brahmin decides to lead a life adhering to the pure
lifestyle of a Brahmin, his life is of the highest kind. He feels that
his clothes are of the highest kind. What does he do, by choosing
them with the conviction of their superiority? What he does, is to
take a decision to lead an elevated lifestyle. This is called saadhan
(effort for spiritual progress).
Some twenty five years ago I had seen a thousand pair of shoes at
somebody’s house. At first I thought that it was a shop. Then I
asked the Seth, ‘Whose shoes are these? Why are they kept here?’
He began to smile. ‘They are mine, Maharaj,’ he said. ‘When I go
out, I choose the ones I want to wear, depending upon the
occasion and my clothes.’ Now, this sadhana is not a pair of shoes
that a person can wear for five minutes and change at will.
Sadhana means to take a lofty, excellent decision that as long as
you live – and even after your death, if your subtle body remains –
you will adhere to your decision. When you make a lifetime’s
habit to lead a superior life it is called ‘saadhanaa’. It is not that
you spend some money, work for an hour, and bring back the
result.
Your life is everlasting, and you accept the things that are
everlasting, and most superior. You resolve to adopt them
throughout your life. When you practice this day after day, and it
becomes habitual, you inculcate the sanskaara (subtle
subconscious impressions), and that becomes sadhana. Sadhan
(effort for spiritual progress) does not mean singing or dancing for
218

## Page 219

a while. Sadhan is when you choose the highest kind of lifestyle
for your eternal life. And, since you have not yet made it into a
habit – since it is not yet a natural inclination for you – you have
to keep repeating it till it becomes habitual. Unless you
understand this, you will get fed up in a few days and give it up.
You haven’t seen the face of sadhan yet.
Tadbuddhayastadaatmaanastannishthaastatparaayanaah,
gachhantyapunaraavrittim gnaananirdhootakalmashaah.
(5. 17)
(Those whose mind and intellect take on the form of the
Sacchidananda Paramatma, and are established in Him, obtain the
Gnan that frees them from sin. They are not reborn. They are
liberated.)
Look, I will tell you one sadhan.
Na prahrishye`tpriyam praapya nodvije`tpraapya chaapriyam,
sthirabuddhirasammoodho brahmavid brahmani sthitah.
(5.20)
(A person who is not elated when he gets what he likes and is not
agitated when he gets what he doesn’t like, whose mind is steady
and free of doubts, who has knowledge about the Brahman, is
always established in the Brahman.)
Unite your life with the infinite. Understand the Brahman. Be one
with the Brahman. The Brahman is not something like a ghost in
time. The Brahman is what you are, and you are what the
Brahman is. But, this is just like someone asking a child, ‘Where
is your house?’
‘It is opposite my uncle’s house.’
‘Where is your uncle’s house?’
‘Opposite my house.’
‘Where are both the houses?’
‘Opposite each other.’
219

---

## Page 220

Now, can anyone find out the location of the houses?
Similarly, what is the Brahman? It is what you are. What are you?
You are what the Brahman is! From this, you have to understand
that the Brahman means the infinite. Have no doubts. No matter
how many changes occur, no matter how man times you return, or
how many illusions you face, stay firmly established in your
essence, because you are the Brahman.
‘Na prahrashye`tpriyam praapya’ – don’t swell with joy when
you get what you like. Things won’t always go the way you want
them to be. That is certain. ‘Nodvije`tpraapya chaapriyam’ –
don’t become depressed when you get what you dislike. Don’t
commit suicide, because the situation won’t last. This, too, will
change.
‘Sthirabuddhi’ raga-dvesha have left you, since
‘prahrishye`tpriyam praapya’ indicates the absence of raga, and
‘nodvije`tpraapye chaapriyam’ indicates the absence of dvesha.
‘Asammoodhah’ means that under no circumstances are you
deluded or trapped. When a baby gets stuck in the womb, it is
called ‘garbha moodha’ in Ayur Veda. Similarly, when you get
caught in circumstances, feel suspended in midair, or that you
have lost your way, you become. Bhagwan said, ‘No! No!
Sthirabuddhi! Remain mentally steady. The objects of attachment
and aversion will come and go. Why do you feel frightened?
Retain mental stability. Don’t get caught up in things, no matter
what the situation may be.’
Then, what should we do?
Let your intellect be unwavering – sthirabuddhi. Understand that
your life is infinite, and remain steady in life. This is not a
Samadhi. Don’t think that this condition is restricted to a cave in
Tibet, or to a state of deep meditation. This is an inner state that
wanders around in the crowded market of Kalbadevi, or the snack
vendors at Chowpatty.
Na prahrashye`tpriyam praapya nodvije`tpraapya chaapriyam
sthirabuddhirasammoodho.
220

## Page 221

A king would be a fool, were he to say that the whole populace
should live in the palace, because this is impossible. In the same
way, it is not possible that Bhagwan would say that all the people
should go to a cave in Tibet. Nor does Bhagwan say that
everybody should do soorya namaskaara (a Yogic exercise done
as a worship to the sun), or apply sandalwood paste on the
forehead horizontally or vertically. He does not say that
everybody should don yellow or red garbs. I challenge anyone to
show me any such mention in the Gita. My brother, Bhagwan has
no wish to imprison everybody in caves, eat tasty snacks at
Chowpatty, or take up a gun and join the Army. Bhagwan says,
‘Wherever you are, you are all right.’ Every policeman stationed
at a cross-road, every doctor, engineer, Judge, and others, should
be steady in the position they have been allotted. They should not
be deluded by raga-dvesha.
The Gita teaches us how to live an everlasting life. Every action
and indulgence leaves us with some knowledge. This is called the
‘fala’ – the fruit. Fala does not mean a mango or jackfruit! It
means the subtle subconscious impressions made by our actions.
It means the internal reaction of an external activity. Therefore,
the waking up and going to sleep, and the birth and death that
come and go in our eternal life, are of no more importance than
worldly interaction. We should become absolutely steady in our
place, in our essence, which is the Brahman.
Sthirabuddhirasammoodho brahmavid brahmani sthitah.

Pravachan XVI
The highest sadhana – Gnan sadhana.
The Gita has a meaning, and that meaning is that we should try to
remain established in that, which we wish to attain.
Suppose the object of your desire is something separate,
unattained, and elsewhere – like Goloka (the abode of Shri
Krishna), Vaikuntha (the abode of Bhagwan Vishnu), Saket (the
abode of Shri Rama), Kailash (the abode of Shankar Bhagwan) –
if there is a form that you have not got, what saadhan (effort for
spiritual progress) will you do? The only sadhan you can do to
attain it is to touch it repeatedly in your imagination. Just do this
much. Just as you touch something physically, touch the object of
your aspiration with your mind. Look at Shri Rama’s lovely face
again and again. Embrace Shri Krishna repeatedly. See yourself as
Shiva again and again. This is the method for obtaining them. If
we start touching them in our imagination, it is called japa (ritual
chanting), it is called pratyaahaara (withdrawing the senses), it is
called dhaaranaa (bringing the mind back repeatedly to the object
of meditation). And, when it becomes more concentrated, it
becomes dhyaana (meditation). The thing is that you have to
make the effort to touch them mentally, again and again.
Very well; if your goal is to be established in the essence of your
Self, give up all other forms. Vive`ka (discrimination) is
paramount in this. Similarly, if you wish to attain what you do not
have – Shri Rama, Shri Krishna, Shiva – you should touch them
mentally, with shraddhaa (faith) and pre`ma (pure love). To be
established in your essence you should use discrimination and
give up everything that is not your essence.
Ordinary people think that they will obtain the Ishwara if they do
some daana (giving in charity). ‘We will give five rupees and get
Swarga (Heaven),’ they think. Swarga is like a luxury hotel that
provides comfort and sensual pleasures, air planes, celestial
nymphs, gardens, a superb physique, and the finest clothes.
222

## Page 223

People want all these, but they want it by cheating! They want to
obtain all this for a paltry price!
Some people think that if they give up some item or activity they
will get the Ishwara, and some believe that they can get Him by
doing some rituals. They think the Ishwara can be attained by
giving money or materials, doing pious deeds, giving up things, or
obtaining some things. The opinion of the Gita is –
Shre`yaan dravyamayaadyagnaajgnaanayagyah parantapa,
sarvam karmaakhilam paartha gnaane` parisamaapyate`.
(4. 33)
(O Arjuna, the one who causes pain to enemies, Gnan Yoga is
superior to dravya Yoga. Giving knowledge is superior to giving
material objects. All actions conclude in Gnan.)
You are to attain a certain position, and that position is the
essence of the Atma that is pure Gnan. When you try to obtain
your goal through indulgences, ritual charity, and religious rituals,
you are moving in the wrong direction. You should turn inwards.
Very well; if you want to obtain Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesh,
Devi, or Narayana, you should mentally touch them again and
again. And, if you wish to be seated in your asanga aatmaa –
your Atma that is absolutely unattached – give up touching
everything, including the Devtas. Do asparsha yoga –the Yoga of
not touching anything. Do sparsha yoga – the Yoga of touch –
only if you wish to obtain your Ishta Devta (chosen form of
worship).
Asparshayogo vai naama durdarshah sarvayogibhih,
yogino bibhyati hyasmaadabhaye` bhayadarshinah.
(Mandukya Karika 3. 39)
It is difficult for other Yogis to see this sparsha Yoga. They see
fear in this state of fearlessness. The Gita’s viewpoint regarding
sadhana is all-pervading. You would have noticed that on the one
hand it says that it is Yoga to worship the Devtas.

Daivame`vaapare` yagyam yoginah paryupaasate`.
(4. 25)
(Some Yogis do the Yagya of worshipping other Devtas through
appropriate rituals.)
People worship the Surya Devta (sun), Agni Devta (fire), Indra
Devta (the Devta of action), Vayu Devta (wind), Varuna Devta
(water), and others. There are many Devtas who are worshipped
as a Yagya. And, see what is said – which is just the opposite – in
the same shloka.
Brahmagnaavapare`yagnam yagne`naivopajuhvati.
(4. 25)
(Some other Yogis do the Yagya of seeing the Atma as the non-
dual essence of the fire that is the Parabram Paramatma.)
Offer up the Yagya you do, in the fire of the Brahman. The
Devtas who are worshipped are many, but the Brahman is one,
and non-dual. So, the meaning of Bhagwan’s words is that it is a
Yagya to make offerings to the many, and it is also a Yagya to
make offerings to the one. If anyone says that the worship of
different Devtas is a sadhana, but the offerings in the fire of the
Brahman is not, that is a pantheeya (restricted to a Sect) outlook.
Actually, the all-pervading viewpoint is to accept the authenticity
of both methods.
A person can offer oblations to the many forms of the Brahman.
He can do Yagyas for different Devtas, offer oblations to Surya
Devta or into a ritual fire, pour milk into the sea or a river, do
Yogic breathing as worship to the wind, or meditate that no such
thing as duality exists in the non-dual Brahman. All these are
sadhan. The characteristic of the followers of Panthas (Sects) is
that they accept one sadhan, and refute other methods for spiritual
progress.
224

## Page 225

Who is a panthaayee (follower of a Pantha)? It is someone who
accepts Rama as the Ishwara, but not Krishna; or accepts Krishna
but not Rama. Or, he accepts Rama-Krishna but not the Ishwara
without form, or the reverse. The viewpoint of sadhana is
extraordinary; it is amazing! Look; I will recite a shloka.
Shrotraadeeneendriyaanyanye` sanyamaagnishu juhvati,
shabdaadeenvishayaananya indriyaagnishu juhvati.
(4. 26)
(Some Yogis restrain all their senses as a Yagya, and others offer
up the sense objects into the fire of their senses as a Yagya.)
Have you ever given thought to this shloka? You will see that the
first half tells you to offer up your senses into the fire of restraint;
the second half says, ‘shabdaadeenvishayaananya indriyaagnishu
juhvati.’ Use your ears to listen, eyes to see, nose to smell, tongue
to taste, and skin to feel. Work with your hands, and walk with
your feet. All these will become a Yagya. One part says that it is a
Yagya to gather up and restrain all your senses, and the other part
of the same shloka says that it is a Yagya to use all your senses.
You see, where there is only one method of worship, there is no
scope for people with different inclinations, individual
understanding, different tasks, and temperaments to do the
sadhana that suits them the best. This is what a Pantha is. If
everyone were to do Namaz, it would be an Islamic kingdom and
if everyone were to do Sandhya Vandan it would be a kingdom of
Brahmins.
Some people can do Namaz, some can do Sandhya Vandan and
some can say their prayers. Some will worship a dark form and
some will worship a fair form. Some can dance and sing as bhajan
(devotional worship), and some can do bhajan with closed eyes.
Nobody has the right to forbid any other. See the Gita’s
magnanimous outlook regarding bhajan. In case you have not
observed it earlier, please note it now.

Shrotraadeeneendriyanye` sanyamaagnishu juhvati,
shabdaadeenvishayaananya indriyaagnishu juhvati.
The indreeya (senses) are the fire. The ears are the havan kunda
(the vessel in which the sacred fire is lit). Pour the oblations of
your words into this fire. This is your sadhan. If this is not what
you desire, give it up. If you are incapable of doing it, give it up.
Give it up if you don’t understand, or if your Guru has forbidden
you to do it. There are only four reasons for giving up some
sadhana. And, if it is something you want, if you have the
capacity to do it, if you understand it and if your Guru has not
forbidden it, please do it.
Shrotraadeeneendriyaanyanye` sanyamaagnishu juhvati – self
restraint is a fire. The agni kunda (the vessel in which the sacred
fire is lit) is self-restraint. The offerings that are put into this fire
are the indriyas. How should you make the offering? Keep your
eyes focused on the point where your nose begins, just below your
forehead. In a little while you will get a subtle fragrance. Focus
your mind on the fragrance and offer up you sense of smell. Offer
up what you see with your eyes – you will see a myriad of colors.
You will also experience strange flavors. Offer them up. This
means, you have five senses and five organs of action. They are
all to be immersed as a sacrificial offering into the five elements
of which this world is made. They will then no longer be
individual senses or organs of action. This becomes a sadhana.
Have you ever heard about the sadhana of sound? Au…………m,
raa…………m, raa……….m, so……….hum. Make your hearing
acute and listen to the inner sound. There is a Sect in Varanasi,
called the Kinaram Sect. They have branches in many other
places, but it originated at Ramgadh, some eight or ten miles from
my village near Varanasi. They have had many miraculous
incidents. The followers of this Sect begin their sadhan from the
naval, at the energy center called the manipooraka charka. The
stomach expands when you take a deep breath. If you focus on
this, it is called the sadhana of sparsha (touch). The first sign is a
226

---

## Page 227

faint sound, ‘saanya-saanya’, and then you can hear ‘Rama-
Rama’. When you concentrate on this sound it becomes the
sadhana of sound. I am telling you this for your information.
When you hear of something new and run after it, it creates a
break in your nishthaa (faith). Are you Ishta nishtha (having faith
in your chosen form of worship), dhyana nishtha (having faith in
meditation), mantra nishtha (having faith in your mantra), or Guru
nishtha (having faith in the Guru)? Your shraddhaa (faith) in
them is broken when you run after new methods of sadhana. The
Gurus of the Sects say that they are shaking you up, but what it
means is that these things make you waver in your sadhana.
So, you see, one of the Gita’s sadhans is that you should restrain
your senses, and another sadhan is that you should offer the sense
objects to your senses. The sadhana of the bhaktas starts from the
heart. The sadhana of the Kinarami’s starts from the naval. The
sadhana of the Radha Swamis starts from the aagya charka (the
energy center on the forehead). The sadhana of the Tantriks starts
from the moolaadhaara charka (the energy center at the base of
the spine), rising to the sahasraara charka (on the crown of the
head). They believe in the existence of many loka (realms), like
Satya Loka and others. In one of their sadhanas you start from the
muladhara charka, awakening the energy called the Kundalini,
which goes up to the sahasrara and merges into the Guru. You
will get the same experience that your Guru had.
Another sadhana of theirs starts from the tongue, the vaikharee
vaani (the sound made by the tongue). ‘Raa…………ma,
raa……..ma, raa………ma.’ The sound goes from the tongue to
the throat, then to the heart, then to the svaadhishthaana charka
near the organ of urine, and reaches the muladhara. In other
words, the vaikhari vani goes into the madhyamaa vaani, which
goes into the pashyanati vaani, then the paraa vak, and finally
obtains the Paramatma in the muladhara charka.
Recently I got a letter from a learned scholar. ‘Maharaj,’ he wrote,
‘in one place it is written that we can obtain the Paramatma if we
move upwards. In another place it is written that we can obtain
227

---

## Page 228

Him if we move downwards, to the muladhara charka. Please tell
me where the Paramatma dwells. Is He in the head or in the
muladhara?’ This was his question!
You people are laughing to hear this, because you are
knowledgeable people. The man who wrote this letter is a highly
learned person, knowing both methods, but he was confused as to
where the Paramatma is to be found. The bhaktas say that the
Paramatma dwells in the hriday (heart). The Tantriks say that He
dwells in the head. People who worship the para vak say that He
dwells in the muladhara. One Sect says that He dwells in the
manipuraka charka (the naval).
I can tell you more if you want. There is a Pantha in which people
meditate on the Paramatma in their big toe. In this Pantha, too,
there are Gurus who have their disciples, handed down
traditionally from generation to generation. You will be shocked
to think of the Paramatma dwelling in your big toe! There is logic
in this, however. The Devtas have different positions in our body.
For example, Indra is the Devta of action and abides in the arms.
Surya is the Devta of vision and abides in the eyes. Agni is the
Devta of speech, and Vishnu is the Devta of the feet. If you want
to meditate on the Surya, you have to use the upaadhee
(superimposed factor) of the eyes; and if you want to do dhyana of
Vishnu, it is through the upadhi of the feet, because Vishnu is the
supporter of everything.
I am telling you all this so that you do not waver from your
sadhana. When somebody comes with an intention to make you
change your Guru, he drags you down. When he comes to make
you change your mantra he drags you down. He has a vested
interest that you should do the japa of the mantra he gives you,
and meditate on the Ishta Devta he recommends. He does all this
in order to make you his disciple. Don’t you recognize his selfish
motive? When he is working for his own benefit, how can your
interest be his primary consideration? There are so many different
kinds of sadhana. I can tell you about them if you want, but it is
228

## Page 229

better for you that I don’t. When immature people are given such
information it creates a breach in their sadhana.
One day, when I was in Rajasthan, I was talking to Bhaiji, Shri
Hanuman Prasadji Poddar. A disease called ‘naharaa’ was
mentioned.
‘What is this illness?’ I asked Bhaiji.
‘Don’t you know about it?’ he asked.
I confessed my ignorance. ‘Well, since you don’t know, it is better
not to obtain information about it,’ he said. ‘People who have
extensive knowledge about illnesses begin to imagine that they
have the symptoms of some disease. They turn into
hypochondriacs.’ If you hear about all these Sects and their
strange rituals, there is a chance that they may become
superimposed upon your mind. Then your sadhana will be left
behind.
I can enumerate the names of the different Sects for you. I have
detailed knowledge about over a hundred Sects. I had memorized
them when I was about sixteen or seventeen years old, the way
children learn their lessons by heart. There is a Nyaya Pantha. Is
there sorrow in your life or not? This is a straight question.
Sorrow is there in your life. Now, how can this sorrow be
removed? It is not possible for any living being to be completely
free of sorrow as long as they are alive. So, people who think that
no sorrow should ever come into their life are avive`kee (lacking
in discrimination). Let me give them this title! If you hope to
never have any pain in life, that is you first mistake.
‘Taanstitikshasva bhaarata’ – cultivate the habit of enduring heat
and cold.
The effect of sorrow is devastating on the first day. On the second
day, it does not seem so unbearable. After a week or so, it goes
away on its own. Don’t nurture grief. Don’t hold on to sorrow.
Sorrow is bound to come as long as you live. You will fall ill,
things that you don’t like will happen, you will feel hot and you
will feel cold.

(O son of Kunti, when the senses meet the sense objects, you feel
the cold and heat, joy and sorrow. These rise up and die down, so
endure them, O Bharata.
The courageous person accepts these dualities with equanimity.
He does not get swayed by the transient pleasant and unpleasant
experiences. Such a person is eligible for liberation from rebirth.)
If what I am saying does not seem to be a sadhana to you, then no
other sadhana will bring happiness into your life. Unless you pass
over both happy and sorrowful days with equanimity – if you
think that sorrow should never come into your life – you will
always be unhappy. Nobody can be completely happy in this life.
To remove this helplessness, Shankaracharyaji has divided dukha
into two parts. One is the bhramajanya (caused by delusion) and
the other is the doshajanya (caused by faults) dukha. Gautam
Muni, who is the Acharya of the Nyaya Pantha, says that every
kind of dukha is due to dosha (faults). Doshas are responsible for
sorrow. The dukha is in the body, and is due to some dosha.
So, then, what is dosha?
If you ask any Vaidya (doctor of Ayur Veda), he will tell you that
there are three doshas in the body – vaata (wind), pitta (bile) and
cough. Any one, two, or all three can become disproportionate,
causing some illness. Sometimes your behavior offends people
and they become your enemies. It may be that you hurt them in
some way. Now they say and do things that hurt you. Here, the
dosha is the dosha of speech.
Then, there may be some dosha in your mind. This has three
names – raaga (attachment), dve`sha (hatred) and moha
(delusion). Sorrow comes because of your ashubha (inauspicious)
actions, and happiness comes because of your shubha (auspicious)
230

## Page 231

actions. However, raga-dvesha are at the root of both kinds of
actions. Just as the Vaidyas believe vata-pitta-cough to be the
cause of physical suffering, the Nyaya Pantha believes that the
antahkaran (fourfold mind or subtle body) has three doshas –
raga-dvesha-moha.
Attachments and aversions are for external objects, people, places
and situations. Attachment is a sweet poison, and hatred is a bitter
poison. Delusion is the third dosha. It is for the body and the
things that are useful for the body. Actions cannot cause sorrow
unless they contain some dosha. Learn to recognize your doshas.
There is one thing – if I tell you about some sadhana that you can
do for five minutes, many of you will start doing it.
Once, at Prem Kutir, I had spoken about a sadhana that can be
done lying down. You lie down on the bed and divide your body
mentally, into different sections. The part of the feet up to the
thighs is one part. It is the portions of earth. From the thighs to the
organ of passing urine is the part of water. Let the earth merge
into the water mentally. The portion up to the naval is the portion
of fire. Let water be dissolved in the fire. From the naval to the
heart is the portion of the wind. Let the fire disappear into the
wind. Next is the portion of space, up to the neck. Let the wind
vanish into space. Above this is the portion of the mind – in the
eyes, nose, ears, tongue, skin and forehead. Bring everything into
the mind and quiet your mind. If you feel drowsy, go to sleep.
Then, when you wake up, you should reverse this process
systematically before getting up. A great many people asked me
about this sadhana in detail. I don’t think I have received so many
questions about any other sadhana.
Why is that?
One reason is that this sadhana is to be done lying down. There is
no need to take a bath, or put in any other effort. Then, you are
free to go to sleep if you feel sleepy. I had told you that if you
practice this sadhana for six months, your sleep will become a
Samadhi.
231

I am deliberately telling you one thing, and that is, that you should
do manasik tapasyaa (asceticism of the mind). It will have to be
done all twenty four hours. You can check this up in the Gita.
Manah prasaadah saumyatvam maunamaatvinigrahah,
bhaavasanshuddhiritye`tattapo maanasamuchyate`.
(17. 16)
(A feeling of tranquil joy, the habit of thinking about Bhagwan,
control of the mind, and pure emotions – these are the asceticism
of the mind.)
‘Bhaava sanshuddhih’ – when I tell you to do a sadhana that is to
be done round the clock as long as you live, it will be a lifelong
vrata (austerity) of yours. A Brahmin wants that he should, all his
life, apply sandalwood paste on his forehead, and wear the sacred
thread and pure clothes. In the same way, this vrata will purify
your feelings. It will be mental asceticism.
But, you change your dress every day, these days. Earlier, the
correct way to dress was to keep the naval covered. Now the
fashion is for the naval to be seen. Traditional Indian culture is
that both men and women wear garments that cover their naval.
Fashions may change, but the framework of Dharma remains
unchanged. Dharma purifies all feelings. Manah prasaadah. In
life, a person feels like crying at times and wants to laugh at
times. The Gita says, ‘No, my brother, manah prasaadah.
Whoever looks at your face should get the feeling that you are in a
state of tranquil joy.’ Your face is the mirror of your mind. Your
anger, desire, and agitation are invariably reflected on your face.
Whatever is said about you, let it be said. Whatever happens, let it
happen. Why do you allow your mind to linger on the
insignificant matters that flit by for a day or two? Keep your mind
serene and tranquil. Saumyatvam. This is the Pantha of Shri
Krishna and the Gita.
What is the meaning of saumyatvam? ‘Soma’ means the moon.
The moon spreads a radiance that soothes and gives pleasure. The
232

---

## Page 233

characteristic of spreading coolness and pleasure is called
‘saumyatva’. Lovers who are separated and lovers who are united,
look at the moon and are soothed by it. Yogis who sit by the river
in the moonlight, enjoying the cool breeze, go into a Samadhi.
Worldly people delight in the beauty of a moonlit night. A person
whose nature radiates the qualities of the moon is called ‘saumya’,
and the quality itself is called ‘saumyatva.’
Maunam (remaining silent) is an asceticism of the mind, not of
speech. The meaning is that you should not say that, which ought
not to be said. Why should something inappropriate come to your
mind?
‘Bhaavasanshuddhih’. Don’t think about whether the other person
is shuddha (pure), think about whether your feelings are pure. I
got tired of trying to keep my body pure. You people are new to
this; what can I say about my lack of interest? When I was nine, I
would refuse to eat food cooked by a Kshtriya (warrior class). I
don’t remember ever wearing stitched clothes while eating. We
would sit on a wooden seat in the kitchen, after washing our hands
and feet, with a cloth wrapped round the waist. I tried all these
external methods of sadhana, but came to the conclusion that no
matter how hard we try, external purity and external
circumstances only become a burden. We need bhaava-
sanshuddhi (purity of mind).
This mental asceticism is a sadhana to be done round the clock.
You can do maalaa (the rosary) for five minutes, sprinkle water to
purify your body, and sit with your back straight, to do sadhana.
But, just see the sadhana recommended by Shri Krishna.
‘Manahprasaadah’. Your mind should be limpid, absolutely pure.
No bubbles or foam should rise up in it. It should be like the clear
waters of an unruffled lake. This is manahprasaadah. Spread a
ray of sukha (joy), a smile, for everybody. That is saumyatvam. In
case any impulse of ill-will for anyone crops up in your mind, do
aatmavinigrahah (self-restraint). Your feelings towards all should
be pure – bhaavasanshuddhi. It is the Nyaya Pantha I am talking
about. The Vaidyas say that your body will be free of disease if
233

---

## Page 234

the vata-pitta-cough are not disbalanced. Let the vata-pitta-cough
remain in your body, but it is difficult for them to be perfectly in
balance all the time.
Similarly, what the Nyaya Pantha says is that you have the mental
doshas of raga-dvesha-moha. The sorrow that comes to the body
is because of inauspicious actions, and inauspicious actions are
prompted by doshas. Now, see the point about the sadhan that I
am telling you. They say that all the faults in your life are caused
by delusion, nescience, and a false understanding. Gautam Muni
has called this mithyaa gnaana – knowledge that is a relative
truth.
Sarvam karmaakhilam paartha gnaane` parisamaapyate`.
Delusion, or false knowledge causes all the faults. When I was
young, some books on Western philosophy were published by the
Nagari Pracharini Sabha. Mahamahopadhyaya Pundit Ramavatar
Sharma of Patna had a collection of them. One of the principles
put forth in them was that if a person obtains the right Gnan, he
will never act contrary to that Gnan. This is an extraordinary
point. The book said that if somebody brings you a sweet drink,
and you suspect it may be poisoned, you will refuse to drink it.
The drink may be delicious, attractive in appearance, and the
person who brings it may be dear to you. The glass may be made
of gold, yet you will reject the drink if you suspect it contains
poison. And, if you know that it is definitely poisoned, you may
beat up the person who brings it, throw the glass away, and
instigate police proceedings.
Now, the Mahatmas and the Shastras say that the sense objects are
poison. Bhagwan’s Avatars say the same, and so do our elders.
Yet you go on savoring them. Why do you do this?
The reason is that you do not have the proper Gnan about the
poison in the sense objects. You lack Gnan. All the sorrows in
your life and all your inauspicious actions; all your attachments
and aversions and delusions can be destroyed.
234

## Page 235

How can they be destroyed?
They can be destroyed by Gnan.
Na hi gnaane`na sadrisham pavitramiha vidyate`,
tatsvayam yogasansiddhah kaale`naatmani vindati.
(4. 38)
(There is no doubt that in this world there is nothing like Gnan,
for purifying the mind. With the help of Karma Yoga people have,
since ages, purified their minds. A person who does this will
automatically obtain Gnan in his Atma.)
Tadviddhi pranipaate`na pariprashne`na se`vayaa,
upade`kshyanti te` gnaanam gnaaninastattvadarshinah.
(4. 34)
(Go to the Gnanis who have obtained this Gnan and learn it from
them. Bow down respectfully and serve them. Abandon all
artifice. Place your questions with simplicity and
straightforwardness. The Mahatmas who know the Paramatma
will teach you this Gnan.)
Bhagwan is telling us that our intellect must be proper. Faulty
understanding makes you think that you cannot live without
certain people or circumstances. These mistaken beliefs should
go.
Which sadhana are we talking about? Do you want me to teach
you asanas like the sarvaanga aasana, ushtra aasana, or kukkuta
aasana? I used to do some thirty-five or thirty six asanas
regularly. I know the secrets behind them and the benefits they
bring. Is it sadhana, if I teach you these Yogic exercises? I know
the secrets of sadhana, and that is what I am talking about. You
have to first destroy the faulty understanding of your buddhi, and
only when the buddhi’s doshas are removed will you be free of
raga-dvesha-moha. The faults of the intellect must be removed
first. You must get vive`ka (discrimination). Inauspicious
activities will cease when the intellect is free of faults. Only then
235

## Page 236

will sorrows stop coming into the mind. The sorrows caused by
physical illness will become titikshaa (enduring pain as an
asceticism); and the root if mental sorrows will be gone when
attachments, aversions and delusions are gone. This sadhana is the
Nyaya sadhana.
The Gita says:
Yajgyaatvaa na punarmohame`vam yaasyasi paandava,
ye`na bhootaanyashe`shena drakshyasyaatmanyatho mayi.
Apiche`dasi paape`bhyah sarve`bhyah paapakrittamah,
sarvam gnaanaplave`naiva vrijinam santarishyasi.
(4. 35, 36)
(O Arjuna, once you obtain this Gnan you will never get deluded
again. You will see all beings in yourself, and then you will see
them in Me, the Sacchidananda Paramatma.
Even had you been a sinner grater than any other in the world,
there is no doubt that you will be carried over the sea of your sins,
by using the boat of Gnan.)
It does not matter that you are a paapee (sinner), and that you
have sinned. Come; sit on this boat of proper understanding.
‘Sarvam gnaanaplave`naiva.’ Gnaanaplave`naiva means the boat
of Gnan. Sit on the boat of wisdom.
I do not know the sadhana of stupidity that scatters your Gnan and
destroys your ability to think clearly.

Pravachan XVII
It is Essential to Purify the Antahkaran.
When we talk about sadhan, (effort for spiritual progress), there is
some talk of letting go and some talk of holding on. Sadhan is
when an eligible person makes an effort to obtain the saadhya
vastu (the object of sadhana). Sadhan does not mean letting
whatever happens happen. Sadhan does not mean leaving things
to chance. It means trying to obtain the object that is our goal.
This method of obtaining the power to do miraculous feats is not
aadhyaatmika (metaphysical) sadhan. These are for people who
don’t know the tricks of the trade. People who are knowledgeable
about these matters are never taken in by such tricks. The
miraculous feats are based on scientific and natural laws, but a
person who does not understand them finds them miraculous,
whereas a knowledgeable person finds them logical.
When I was a child I would go to the Court with my grandfather.
We were rustic people. We did not know the clever tricks of city
dwellers. There was a man there, who sold medicine for the eyes.
He would send for a glass of water, and pour a few drops of his
medicine into it. The dirt in the water would at once settle down at
the bottom, leaving the water sparklingly clean. ‘Look!’ he would
say. ‘This is a miracle! The medicine removes the dirt form the
water. If you put it into your eyes, the dirt (cataract) in your eyes
will also be removed.’ The villagers would be greatly impressed
when they saw this. What he sold as medicine was the extract of
lemon rind.
In the same way, those who are not involved in the subject of
metaphysical science do not know the secret behind the
phenomenon of ghosts and spirits. They don’t know what
Yakshinis, Sarpinis and Dakinis can do, what mental powers can
do, what people do when they are blindfolded, and how clever
they are. None of this is known to ordinary people. For them,
there is no difference between spiritual power and sleight of hand.

I will tell you something about adhyatma. When you accept some
karma saadhanaa (sadhana through karma), you need bhakti.
Bhakti means the separating of what to do and what not to do.
When you separate the right and proper from the wrong and
improper, you will have bhakti for that which is right. You will
give up everything that is not right. You will have to divide
actions into two parts – the good and the bad. This is called
‘bhakti’ in Sanskrit. Bhakti means separating the good actions
from those that are not good, doing good actions and not doing
anything that is bad or wrong. This is the feeling in sadhan.
If you want to arrange a marriage you will have to separate the
eligible candidates from the ineligible ones. After that you will
have to make a choice out of the ones that are eligible. In the same
way, when we do upaasanaa (devoted worship), we have to
choose a particular form for our worship. That form is called the
Ishta Dev. And, we have to give up all other forms of worship.
That is called bhakti.
Bhakti is in karma, and also in dhyaana (meditation). What is the
bhakti in dhyana? It is that this form is our dhye`ya (object of
meditation; our goal). ‘He is the one for me to worship. I will
establish Him in my heart and remove everything else. I will not
meditate on anything except my Ishta.’
Bhakti is also there in vive`ka (discrimination). I will separate the
drashtaa (the one who sees; the Atma) from the drishya (that,
which is seen). I will do vivek and let go of the drishya,
establishing myself as the drashta. Thus, vivek has the bhakti of
the drashta, and abhakti (no bhakti) for the prapancha (the
interactive world). Upasana and Yoga have bhakti for the Ishwara
and the Ishta, giving up everything else. In karma sadhana, the
bhakti is for the karmas that are right and good. All wrong karmas
are given up.
The effort for obtaining that, which we refer to as Gnan, or
Tattvagnan (knowledge of the essence of the Brahman), involves
none of these bhaktis. Gnan means knowledge about right and
wrong actions; about the Ishta, and what is not the Ishta; about the
238

---

## Page 239

pratyaksha (perceived through the senses) and paroksha (the
unseen, unknown); the pratyaksha and the aparoksha (a direct
personal experience) Atma in interaction. All these are revealed
by Gnan. It is called ‘prative`daviditam matam’. You know a
flower; it is Gnan that reveals the flower to you. You know a
woman; it is Gnan that tells you that this is a woman. To tell the
truth, the Gnan that shows you that this is the form of a woman
and this is the form of a man, this is the form of a flower, pot,
cloth, house, etc, is not separate from the objects it shows.
Nothing has any existence that is separate from Gnan, and
therefore, Gnan cannot be divided or broken into sections. Since
Gnan is indivisible, it cannot separate itself from any other.
Where you have to hold on, or let go, there is bhakti. And, when
the portions or pieces become irrelevant – only awareness exists –
there is Gnan. Gnan informs you whether a man is folding his
hands respectfully, or whether he is shaking his fist threateningly
at you. To understand the Gnan that has the sanskaara (subtle
subconscious impressions) of Dharma, upasana, or Yoga, means
to understand something related to a particular viewpoint. It is
quite different from understanding something that is unrelated to
any viewpoint, because Gnan is needed even to recognize any
sanskara.
Gnan has an extraordinary power that no other sadhana has. It
reveals an object as it is, without coloring it. Upasana colors an
object with feeling. Dhyana colors an object, but Gnan does not
color it; it reveals the object as it is. I am telling you about sadhan
now.
One opinion is that if you make a pledge to do only good things
in your life, giving up everything that does not seem good to you,
your buddhi (intellect; understanding) will be purified. This is the
opinion of the karmavaadi (those who believe in sadhana through
work). Continue doing that, which seems the most superior, and
continue to desist from doing anything lowly. One day you will
see that your life is filled with the most superior, and everything
lowly has dropped out of it.
239

## Page 240

People who do upasana say that karmas are caused by desires.
People do things because they want something. Those who don’t
want anything don’t need to do anything. Wrong actions come
into your life because you want to obtain some external object,
keep something, get stuck to something, or get rid of it. When
desire is avid people want to obtain, or get rid of something even
through unethical means. People cheat when they gamble.
The urges to procure or remove, to obtain or eat, have attachments
and aversions, result in great suffering. You can blame the
Ishwara, karma, and Prakriti (Nature) – if only you were able to
blame your attachments, aversions and desires! So, when you do
upasana, your desires shrink and get attached to the Ishwara.
I know a learned gentleman. He understands what is right and
what is wrong, but he is unable to give up his habit of obtaining
and indulging in worldly pleasures. When you do Bhagwan’s
bhakti it means that you do not allow the worldly objects to be
your Ishta. Your Ishta is the Ishwara who is the root cause of the
whole world. Once you love Him, your worldly desires will leave
you. So will your sorrows. The mind is the cause of all the
sorrows in this world. It is our avid desire that makes us suffer;
not the diamonds, gold, silver, land, house, or any other object.
Your feeling, ‘This is my house that is on fire!’ is what makes you
suffer. It is quite different from the feeling, ‘My neighbor’s house
is on fire.’ Now, is your sorrow caused by the fire, by the house,
or by your feeling of being its owner? The fact is that it is the
feeling of ‘mine’ that makes us suffer.
The meaning of bhakti, therefore, is that Bhagwan becomes
‘mine’ for you; and your ‘I’ becomes His. The Sanyas of a bhakta
is, ‘This watch is not mine.’ Don’t let the watch be the source of
your satisfaction; let Bhagwan be the source. Think of this – when
Bhagwan becomes yours, He will never betray your trust. The
second point is that you will never be separated from Him. He
will never leave you, and go to foreign lands. The third point is
that He will never die. He will never be separated, He will never
240

---

## Page 241

die, and He will never betray you, because He is your
antaraatmaa (the Atma within).
Thus, the karmavadis believe that the mind becomes pure by
doing good deeds and giving up all wrong actions. The upaasaka
(those who do upasana) believe that the mind cannot be purified
unless it is attached to Bhagwan. The Yogis say that you should
not bother about what happens in the external world. You should
make your mind quiet and sit within. To be established in the Self
is the purity of the antahkaran (the fourfold mind).
The Vedantis have their own opinion, which is quite different
from all others. They say that when people say, ‘Everything will
be all right when a person gets Gnan (vivek), or Bhagwan,’ it is
true. People who have discrimination will always reject the things
that sully the antahkaran, and so will the Yogis. Bhagwan will
make the mind pure. The mind of a person who does Karma Yoga
and follows Dharma, will also be purified. However, when a
person obtains the advaita gnaana (knowledge about the non-dual
essence of the Brahman), all his faults will fall away naturally,
and all the good qualities will come into his life.
Sankhya vivek is to separate the drishya from the drashta. Bhakti
vivek is to separate the jagat (world) from the Ishwara. Karma
vivek is to distinguish between good and bad actions. So, when
vivek comes into a person’s life, it brings vairaagya (detachment).
The characteristics of vivek are shama-dama (internal and
external self-restraint), uparati (lack of interest in worldly
objects), and titikshaa (enduring discomfort with equanimity).
Tattvagnan has one weak point, and that is, that people can do
whatever sadhana they want, so long as they have not yet obtained
Tattvagnan. They can undertake rituals of Dharma to purify the
antahkaran, do upasana to get the Ishta’s darshan (vision); they
can do Yoga and establish themselves in the essence of their Ishta
Dev. However, once Tattvagnan is obtained, all these become
redundant. The person has no further need to think about what he
wants his antahkaran to be like, because he no longer has any
241

---

## Page 242

feeing of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ left. This is the greatest miracle about
Tattvagnan. It is both rational and enjoyable.
A man who was involved in scientific research had come to meet
me. He told me, ‘Maharaj, I need vairagya to carry our my
research. I cannot form an unbiased opinion unless I give up raga-
dvesha. While doing my experiments, I need a quiet mind
(shama), and I need to control my senses (dama). My mind has to
be empty of all other matters (uparati). I need faith (shraddha) that
I will succeed. I need endurance (titiksha) to face discomforts. At
times I sit in a cold room and at times I sit in a very hot room. I
need to gather my mind and focus it on my work.’
Now, if shama-dama, uparati, titiksha, shraddha and
samaadhaana (coming to the right conclusion) are needed even
for scientific research, they will naturally be essential in our
search for the Parameshwara. That means, our mind should have
no raga-dvesha if we wish to obtain the right Gnan about
anything. If you get involved in the external world, you will not
know what is happening in the internal world. If a man wants to
establish himself in his essence as a drashta, but says, ‘I will
establish myself in my essence as a karta,’ how can that be done?
It is not possible for kartaapana (the feeling of being the doer)
and drashtaapana (the feeling of being the one who sees) to exist
simultaneously. It is the difference, given in the Vedas and
Upanishads, that Tantra is not the sadhan for only Moksha
(liberation from rebirth); it is also the sadhan for bhoga (worldly
indulgences). Karma and Gnan are both mixed in it. The
Upanishads establish pure Gnan, and point out the essence of the
vastu (object; the Brahman). ‘I’ and ‘mine’ vanish as soon as
Gnan is obtained. This is why the mind does not become
absolutely pure. It cannot be purified because once the purpose of
obtaining Gnan (enlightenment) is achieved, the antahkaran
becomes mithyaa (a relative truth). The antahkaran is negated, and
so are the raga-dvesha in it.
This is why it is the system to purify the antahkaran before
Tattvagnan is obtained. Our Mahatmas have developed the system
242

---

## Page 243

that the antahkaran should be purified first. Samartha Ramdas was
writing the Ramayana, reading it out to Hanumanji as he wrote.
He came to the episode of the Ashoka Vatika. Hanumanji had
gone there, and seen the large lake in it. ‘Shri Janakiji was sitting
under an Ashoka tree. White lotuses bloomed in the lake.’
Hanumanji interrupted Ramdasji. ‘Rama-Rama! The lotuses were
all red. There were no white lotuses in the lake there,’ he said.
They began to argue the point. Ramdasji was of the opinion that
there were white louses in the lake and Hanumanji insisted that
there were only red lotuses there.
‘Very well. Let us ask Sitaji.’
When they asked Mother Sita, she said, ‘The lake had only white
lotuses.’ That meant, Ramdasji was right and Hanumanji was
wrong.
‘Mother,’ said Hanumanji, ‘I saw with my own eyes that the
lotuses were red.’
‘Yes, Hanuman,’ said Sitaji. ‘It is quite true that you saw red
lotuses. At that time you were angry with the Rakshasis, so your
eyes had turned red with rage. Consequently, the lotuses looked
red to you.’ So, when our antahkaran turns red or black, the world
looks red or black to us.
I had once read in a newspaper about a man whose cow refused to
eat dry grass. He had a pair of spectacles made for the cow, with
green glasses. When the spectacles were put on the cow, the straw
looked green to her and she began to eat it.
Once I was going somewhere in a car. The whole district seemed
to be painted green. Then I realized that the car had green glass!
So, the fact is that whatever is seen in this world is influenced by
the molding of the antahkaran. If we want to have a darshan of
Satya, of the Paramartha, we have to cleanse our mind of the hues
of our desires, impressions, perceptions, raga, dvesha, etc.
Otherwise, if someone says that everything is one, a man whose
lust is strong will say, ‘Your wife is like my wife’! On the other
hand, if you purify your antahkaran, and see that there is only one
Ishwara, you will say, ‘The Ishwara, who is in me, is also in
243

---

## Page 244

everyone else. What need is there for me to have any desire?
Everything is one.’
A gentleman used to tell me jokingly, ‘Swamiji, I have almost
obtained Brahmagnan; just a little bit is left.’
‘What is lacking in your Brahmagnan, my brother?’ I asked.
‘Maharaj, I have developed equanimity of outlook to the extent
that I feel everybody’s possessions are mine. What is lacking is
that I don’t feel that my possessions belong to everybody! Nor am
I in any great hurry to achieve this state. If not in this lifetime, I
will get it in my next life!’
Therefore, the Gnan that is free of desire is quite different. This is
why you have to purify your antahkaran and then obtain Gnan
about the Satya, the Truth, the Paramartha.

Pravachan XIX
Develop Daivi Sampada – 2.
(Daan, Dama, Svadhyaya)
Daivi sampada (the wealth of divine qualities) should come into
the life of a human being. ‘Maa shuchah sampadam
daiveemabhijaatosi paandava.’ Bhagwan Shri Krishna tells
Arjuna, ‘Don’t grieve, Arjuna. You have been born with the Daivi
sampatti.’
While describing the Daivi sampada, Shri Krishna commenced
with ‘abhaya’ (fearlessness). Bhaya (fear) is of two kinds. One
kind comes from outside and one comes from within, because of
our sanskaara (subtle subconscious impressions) and vaasanaa
(strong desires). A hooligan comes to beat us with a stick, but he
comes from within. These are the two parts of fear. The way to
remove both kinds is to wash away the desires that have come into
the Sattva (pure existence) of our mind. Yesterday I had told you
that sattva sanshuddhi means having a pure mind and having
dhairya (fortitude) in our life.
If someone embarks on a journey of a hundred or five hundred
miles, expecting no problems with his car, he is likely to face a
setback. It is a mistake to assume that a long journey is sure to be
free of problems. Don’t set off with the conviction that your
journey will be absolutely smooth. Make sure that your spare tyre
is in a good condition, and be prepared to face whatever obstacles
you encounter.
Very few people have the conviction that whatever the Ishwara
does is for our good, or, ‘My Atma is eternal and undying. It will
cross over all difficulties.’ People who lack this conviction get
trapped by fear half way through their journey. In rural areas it
often happens that darkness sets in before travelers reach a proper
resting place. ‘We don’t know what lies ahead,’ they say. ‘There
may be some ghosts or spirits. Let us turn back.’ They decide to
postpone their journey.
245

## Page 246

Our adhyatma shaastra (the scriptures dealing with metaphysical
matters) say that if we feel fear we should find out what the truth
is. There is no fear in the truth. Fear abides in agnaana (lack of
Gnan) of the Satya, not in the Gnan of the Satya. So, to remove
the external causes of fear we need to know the facts of the
matter. We need the proper Gnan – gnaaavyavasthiti. You would
have noticed that whenever you experienced fear, your mind
would have been restless. It would not have been steady; it would
have been sullied.
Thus, ‘abhayam sattvasanshuddhih’, and ‘gnaanayoga-
vyavasthiti’ are the two answers to the two kinds of fear. You
need to be vyavasthita (organized; well established), and purify
your mind. And, this vyavasthiti is of two kinds – one is
gnaanavyavasthiti and the other is yogavyavasthiti. One point is
that you should know what the Satya is, and the other point is that
you should have a steady mind. Fear will not come to you if your
mind is steady.
Is there a higher purpose in your life? If you have a lofty goal in
life, you will work for it, but if there is no goal – or if you have
achieved you life’s goal – there will be no eagerness in you, for
working. The fact is that when there is a great ideal that someone
wants to achieve, he becomes vyavasthita in his sadhan and in
Yoga (being attached to Bhagwan). His mind is steady, and he is
firm in his resolve. He is vyavasthita in Yoga. Then, he proceeds
on his path without fear. There is one point in this: if a sadhak
wants a companion, and wants his path to be free of anything and
anyone he is averse to, his resolve to reach his goal is not likely to
succeed. On the other hand, if a person feels, ‘I have no goal to
reach’, how will he progress? So, when we lead a life that has no
goal, it is difficult to say where we will go.
A man works because he is attracted to a girl who works in the
same office. The girl gets married and changes her job. The man
no longer feels like going to the office, because he has no interest
in working. All he was interested in was to sit beside the girl he
246

liked. Such a person will never achieve anything great. He has
turned away from all lofty aspirations.
Sattva sanshuddhi, therefore, means that you should do your work
to achieve your life’s goal. It also means that you should not have
the aham bhaava (feeling of ‘I’) in the body. You should not
desire anything worldly in exchange of your work. Work only to
attain the great goal you have set for yourself. For this, you need
knowledge as well as sadhan. ‘Gnaanayoga-vyavasthiti’ – Gnan
means knowledge and Yoga means sadhan.
Daanam damashcha yagyashcha svaadhyaayastapa aarjavam.
(16. 1)
(Give in charity, with the lofty tendency of Sattva guna. Restrain
your senses. Worship Bhagwan, the Devtas, and your elders.
Undertake the admirable tasks recommended by the Vedas and
the Shastras. Study the Vedas and Shastras. Chant Bhagwan’s
name and sing His praises. Endure the discomfort in the course of
doing your duty. Be straightforward in all you think, say, and do.)
Do daan (give in charity). When I see the way worldly people do
daan, I sometimes feel pity for them and sometimes like laughing
at them. People think that the village hooligan will harass them
unless they give him something. When daan is done out of fear, to
appease someone, it is not daan. You cannot make a sankalpa
(formal resolve through a ritual) to do daan of black money to a
Government officer, with a wish to get a license.
What is the viewpoint with which daan is done? Do you do
charity to show people how generous you are? It is a different
thing to make a name for yourself as a great daanee
(philanthropist), and a different thing to advertise your business.
Let us discuss the daan of Dharma for a while. We need not
bother about those who do daan for bhoga (worldly indulgences)
and yasha (getting a good name). I want to draw your attention to
another direction of daan.
247

## Page 248

Daanam damashcha yagyashcha – in the process of earning
wealth, we may cause suffering to others. Perhaps some share of
theirs has come to us. Dharma daan is done to remove these faults
and purify the money we have. Once, when I was at Vrindavan, a
doctor invited me for a meal. I accepted his invitation. A few days
later, he invited me again. Sant Kokil Sain told me, ‘Swamiji,
please don’t eat at this man’s house.’
‘Why? I asked.
‘This man makes money unethically, in the medicine and
treatment he gives his patients. He gives them the wrong medicine
and overcharges them. The food bought with his earning will
create disease in your body.’ Worldly people seldom understand
these factors. They don’t realize that their income has been the
cause of another’s suffering, or that it has been obtained unjustly.
These doshas accompany the money that comes into the house.
Therefore, the faults of causing suffering, or obtaining money
unethically, are removed by the daan we do. This is the sankalpa
that is done when doing daan. If you are convinced that nobody
has suffered because of the wealth you have earned, and that it is
honestly earned, I have nothing to say to you. You need not do
daan. However, if the method of your income has any injustice in
it, or if it has caused suffering to another, then that wealth will
bring no sukha (happiness) into your house. So, the meaning of
daan is to remove the faults that are inherent in your income.
I must have told you this before. A man who lived in Delhi
noticed that the light was on in his accounts room. He looked at
the clock and saw that it was midnight. Intrigued, he went to see
who was working so late. He saw the chief accountant bent over
the books.
‘My brother, why are you working so late?’ he asked. ‘All the
others left long ago.’
‘The accounts do not tally, Sir,’ replied the accountant. ‘I am
trying to find the mistake and rectify it.’
248

## Page 249

‘Well, do it tomorrow,’ said the man. Then he asked, ‘Is there a
deficit or a surplus? If there is a deficit, just cancel it, and if there
is a surplus, return it tomorrow.’
‘There is no deficit, Sir. The accounts show a surplus. I wanted to
locate the person who has been charged excess by our
Government officers, and put aside this amount today itself. Who
knows which poor man has been taxed unfairly? It is better to
separate his money before his suffering sets fire to the wealth in
the treasury.’ Thus, the purpose of daan is the removal of the
doshas (faults) that have crept into our income. Daan purifies
wealth. This viewpoint is, however, very coarse compared to the
viewpoint of Dharma.
Pundit Madan Mohan Malviya had told us an interesting parable.
He was a powerful speaker. His words had a power to convince
that was quite magical.
A Brahmin went to a King. ‘I want money to get my daughter
married,’ he said.
‘I don’t have any money today,’ replied the King. ‘I will give you
some money tomorrow.’
That night the King disguised himself and went into the city. He
worked as a laborer and earned a few coins. He gave these to the
Brahmin the next day. The Brahmin was astonished at the paltry
amount, but too embarrassed to say anything. He went home and
gave the coins to his wife. The wife threw them out of the window
in disgust. It is heard that a tree grew where the coins fell.
Diamonds and pearls grew on the tree like fruit. Thus, the daan we
do should be honestly earned, whether it is a paltry amount or a
huge one.
I will tell you another point about Dharma. The daan that is done
to win a good name is called ‘shre`ya praaptyartha daana’. The
daan done to remove the faults in the income is called ‘dhana
doshanivrityartha daan’, and the daan done to purify wealth is
called ‘parigraha-janya dosha nivrityartha daan.’ The fruit of
Dharma is not external. People feel proud if they are invited to
give a speech, or made the President of some committee, if their
249

---

## Page 250

picture is printed in the newspaper, or if they sponsor some
charity. Such daan can be compared to a man who has a large
lake, and he dips a blade of grass into it and sprinkles a few drops
of water for someone. People don’t do daan in proportion to their
wealth.
There is a common proverb –
Choree karein nihaaya kee, karien sui ko daan,
oopara chadhakara de`khate` ke`tike doora vimaana.
(People steal huge amounts, and do daan worth a needle. Then
they go up to the roof to see if the air plane is coming, to take
them to heaven for the great charity they have done!)
Now, see another point about daan. You give a glass of water to
somebody who is thirsty, and feel happy to have done a good
deed. The vanity of giving someone a glass of water seeps into
your mind. I tell you truly, this is not the fruit of Dharma.
On the other hand, if you think, ‘There are so many in this world
who are thirsty and hungry, who don’t have clothes; are needy and
unemployed! My service is so insignificant compared to the
world’s needs!’ you have got the fruit of Dharma. Your aham
bhaava (ego) is removed; whereas the pride of doing a good deed
becomes a cause of sorrow. Dukha increases when pride
increases.
People feel, seventeen times a day that they have been insulted.
They are not really insulted; they just feel that they have been
insulted! This is because of excessive pride. If you get a glass of
water for someone and feel proud, you are creating sorrow for
yourself. If the fruit of your action is sorrow, it cannot be Dharma;
it will be adharma (that, which is contrary to Dharma). The fruit
of adharma is dukha and the fruit of Dharma is sukha.
Now; I wanted to talk about daan. Material objects are important
in daan. You can do daan of some chala vastu (movable object)
like a cow or buffalo, horse or elephant. And, you can give
immovable things like a house or some land.
250

## Page 251

Then there is daan with the importance of holy places, like Kashi,
Prayag, Haridwar, Badrinath, etc. Daan is also done with the
importance of time, like during an eclipse, at Sanskranti or
Ekadashi, etc.
And daan is given to a satpaatra (worthy candidate).
De`she` kaale` cha paatre` cha taddaanam saatvikam smritam.
(17. 20)
(In daan the factors to be considered are the best time, place, and
person. Daan that is free of any consideration of a return is called
a Sattvik daan.)
Which is the best time and place for doing daan? It is,
‘Satpaatram yatra labhyate` - the place and time you get a worthy
candidate.’ There are two viewpoints even in this – one viewpoint
is the dhaarmik (of Dharma) viewpoint, and the other is the
aadhyaatmik (metaphysical) viewpoint.
These days, most people do daan with an aadhibhautik
(materialistic) viewpoint, and not the aadhidaivik (divine)
viewpoint. An adhidaivik or adhyatmik viewpoint is necessary for
Dharma to be created. Daan done with a materialistic viewpoint
has a different purpose.
The adhyatmik viewpoint is, first of all, satpaatram yatra
labhyate` - wherever you have the feeling, ‘Bhagwan is here’.
You may feel that He has come as a beggar, a man of great
learning, or a Mahatma. The moment you feel that Bhagwan has
come in this form is the best time to do daan, and this form is the
best person to give daan to.
The fact is that the real paatra (recipient) of daan is Bhagwan
Himself. This viewpoint is called the adhidaivik viewpoint. What
is so special about this viewpoint? I will tell you! There is a
calculation in this; there is nothing haphazard about it. Consider,
who is the Master of the world? It is the Ishwara. To whom does
everything belong? Everything belongs to Bhagwan. In that case,
‘Te`raa tujhako saunpate` kyaa laagata hai mor’ (what do I lose
251

---

## Page 252

by returning to You what already belongs to You?) When you
offer up anything to the Ishwara, the vanity of being a
philanthropist does not arise.
Me`raa-me`raa kuchha nahin, jo kuchha hai so tor,
te`raa tujhako saunpate` kyaa laagata hai mor’.
Samarpana (offering up), is giving something with the thought
that you are offering it to the Ishwara who abides in this person.
When you do daan to a Brahmin, the idea is that your
possessiveness of the object is removed, and his possessiveness
over it is established. When you give something to the Ishwara –
who has come in the form of this person – it is samarpan; but
when you give to a Brahmin it is daan.
I will tell you one more point about daan. ‘This object does not
belong to me. Who does it belong to? Does it belong to the
Ishwara, or Prakriti (Nature), or someone else? I don’t know. I
know only that it is not mine.’ This feeling is the tyaaga (giving
up; sacrificing) form of daan. Do you understand the difference?
Daan means removing our feeling of ownership over something,
and transferring the feeling of ownership to the person who
accepts it. It does not mean inviting your cook on the day of the
shraaddha (feeding a Brahmin on the death anniversary of an
ancestor), giving him a good meal, a dhoti and five rupees. You
tell your cook, ‘Maharaj you are the family purohit (Brahmin
advisor). Please remember this while cooking our meals.’ This is a
different daan, and quite the wrong kind!
Daan is destroyed in two ways. It is destroyed when ashraddhaa
(lack of faith) comes into the mind of the donor; and it is
destroyed when given to a relative you wish to please. It is a
common practice in Brahmin families, to invite a relative on the
day of the shraaddha, saying, ‘After all, he is a Brahmin.’ Then,
people say, ‘Let us make him our permanent purohit.’ They make
their son-in-law the family purohit, giving him all the gifts as
daan. This is not the method of daan.
252

---

## Page 253

Another method of daan is that when you give something to a
poor man, you are not doing him a favor. You give what belongs
to Bhagwan to His son.
Then, there is the viewpoint of vairaagya (detachment) in daan.
The ‘Yoga Vashistha’ has a section called the ‘Vairagya
Prakaran’. In it, a poor man comes to Bhagwan Shri Ramachandra
asking for wealth.
‘My brother,’ says Shri Rama, ‘why do you want wealth? Wealth
contains many problems and dangers. I am harassed because I
have to take care of it. Why do you want to invite this
harassment? Please take it if you want; you will relieve Me of this
problem.’
This is the viewpoint of vairagya in daan. There are also the
viewpoints of Dharma and bhakti; and Tattvagnan (knowledge
about the essence of the Brahman), that nothing exists, except the
Brahman. What, then, belongs to us or to someone else? I have
told you about Tattvagnan, because you are used to hearing about
it, and nothing less will satisfy you.
Come; let me tell you something more about daan. There are large
tomes that discuss the philosophy of daan. Apart from Himadri’s
‘Daan Khand’ in Sanskrit, there is ‘Itikrityakaumudi’, and
different Puranas, like the Bhavishya Purana, Garuda Purana, and
Skanda Purana. They have separate sections on daan. You will see
that your chitta (mental inclination) has a separate area of
mamataa (possessive attachment). Suppose there is a flat of 3,000
sq. ft., your mamata will be 3,000 ft. What daan does is that when
you relinquish your possessiveness over one foot of the flat by
giving it in daan, your mamata is reduced to 2, 9999 feet.
It is mamata that creates sorrow, not objects. A man does not
cause sorrow by dying. A house does not cause sorrow by burning
down. The sorrow is caused by your mamata for the person or the
house. Once the house is sold, it will make no difference to you if
it burns down. When some valuable object is broken, people ask,
‘Was it insured?’ The sorrow is reduced if the broken object is
insured.
253

## Page 254

Talking about insurance reminds me of something. I will tell you
about it. We had gone to the Kumbha Mela, from the Gita Press.
We had put up a book shop there for the duration of the Mela. I
had also been staying in the shop, but had left for the station when
a fire started. The whole shop was gutted.
The Gita Press made a claim of fourteen thousand rupees, and was
awarded the full amount. Seth Jaydayalji asked about the total
worth of the books sent to the shop. He was told that books worth
fourteen thousand rupees had been sent.
‘Were all the books burnt in the fire?’ he asked. ‘Were no books
sold before the fire started?’
‘Yes, Sir, books worth seven thousand rupees had been sold.’
‘Was the money burnt in the fire, or is it safe?’
‘The money was not kept at the shop. It was kept in the city, and it
is safe.’
‘Why did you claim fourteen thousand rupees, if books worth
seven thousand had already been sold?’ The Gita Press returned
seven thousand rupees to the insurance company.
Now I will tell you a little about Dharma. Dharma is that, which
purifies our antahkaran. It is a different thing to talk glibly, have
your picture in the papers, or win a good name in society; and
quite a different thing to remove the impurities hidden in your
heart.
There was a man who used to do a lot of daan. One day, I praised
him to someone, saying, ‘This man does a lot of daan.’
It is possible that the man I was talking to had a strong asooyaa
vritti (a tendency to find fault), or what he said may have been
true. ‘Maharaj,’ he said, ‘that man is a rascal! He does daan to
cover up for his wickedness. He gives generous donations, but
does all sorts of unethical things. The daan he does is only to
conceal his misdeeds.’
The fruit of daan is that the antahkaran becomes limpid. What you
have to check is whether your antahkaran has become pure,
whether your heart is inclined towards the Ishwara, whether you
254

---

## Page 255

have become detached from worldly objects, and whether you
have developed the ability to be self-reliant.
Who can do daan? Only a person whose life has dama (strength).
Daanam damashcha yagyashcha svaadhyaayastapa aarjavam.
(16. 1)
(Daan that is Sattvik, senses that are restrained, worship of the
Devtas and elders, doing the daily rituals recommended by the
Shastras, chanting Bhagwan’s names and praising Him, enduring
discomfort in course of doing your duty, and having a pure
antahkaran.)
The three sons of Prajapati Brahma (the Creator) came to him and
asked him for guidance. The Devtas (demigods), Danavas
(demons) and Manavas (humans) have all been created by
Brahmaji. This story is given in the Brahamana section of the
Vedas. All three prayed to Brahmaji to give them a sermon.
Prajapati told the Danavas, ‘My sons, you are my eldest. Da-da-
da. Have you understood?’ The Asuras (demons) said, ‘Yes, you
are telling us to do dayaa (show mercy), because we have a
tendency to be cruel.’
Prajapati asked the Devtas, ‘Have you understood?’
‘Yes,’ they replied. ‘You are telling us ‘damayadhvam’ – do
daman (self-restraint), because we have a tendency for indulging
excessively in sensual pleasures with the Apsaras.’
Prajapati asked the Manushyas, ‘Did you understand anything?’
‘Yes,’ they replied. ‘You are telling us to do daan. We humans
have a tendency for greed. We hoard wealth. The Danavas use up
their wealth in making weapons, and the Devtas in pleasing the
Apsaras (celestial nymphs). Humans accumulate wealth. They do
not spend it for their own benefit, or to help others. They spend
their entire lives in trying to hide the wealth they have.’
This is a wonderful point. I can tell you with full authority that
this point about daan is not mentioned in any other religion –
255

## Page 256

Shraddhayaa de`yam, ashraddhayaa de`yam, bhiyaa de`yam,
hriyaa de`yam, sanvidaa de`yam.
(Give if you have shraddha, and give even if you don’t have
shraddha. Give out of fear, or give out of shame; but do daan!)
The twenty eighth shloka of the seventeenth chapter of the Gita
says that daan done without shraddha (faith) is asat (false). The
Gita tells us not to do daan that lacks shraddha – ashraddhayaa
huta duttam. This has caused some confusion among the
commentators of the Upanishads. However, there is no need to be
confused. Give with faith, give even if you don’t have faith; give
out of fear or give out of shame. Give with full understanding or
give without understanding, but give! Give without fail!
Our great commentators have changed ‘shraddhaa de`yam’ (give
with faith) to ‘ashraddhaa de`yam’ (give without faith). The
meaning is not that we should not have faith in daan; the meaning
is that we should do daan even if we don’t have faith in it.
But, which is the daan that is successful? Damashcha - restrain
your senses, control your impulses. I had been invited to the house
of a gentleman who ate only two items at mealtime. He would
either eat dal-roti, or khichri-sabji. However, when I went, he had
many items prepared for me. ‘I may eat only two items, Maharaj,’
he said, ‘but I would not feel happy if only two items were offered
to you. That would not be proper.’
Now see this – he practiced self-restraint, controlling his own
tongue and hands. But for others, he offered food lavishly, and
gave gifts. Some people are extremely generous. I was telling you
about Harishchandra. We all know what a generous daanee he
was. I have seen people with boundless magnanimity.
There was a gentleman at Chidava, who would put one, two, four
or even five gold coins into the milk and set it to make curd. Then
he would send the pot to someone he wanted to help. People
would think that he has sent nothing more than a pot of curd, but
the curd contained gold coins! When somebody wants bhoga
(luxuries and indulgences) and wealth for himself, he becomes
256

## Page 257

tight fisted. Only a person inclined towards self-restraint can give
generously. ‘Daanam damashcha yagyashcha,’
There is a different angle in doing daan, and a different angle in
restraining the senses. The essence of Yagya is wonderful!
We have moorti poojaa (idol worship). We make an idol of Rama
or Krishna, and worship it. The Bhagwat Mahapurana says that
there are countries where people don’t worship idols. What do
they worship? They worship water, fire, wind, the sun and the
sky. Very well; see the fruit of our worship. When we do a Yagya,
a fragrance fills the air. The air is purified. Uttering the Vedic
verses purifies the sky. Yagya helps learned Brahmins to earn
their living. The fire creates heat. Wealth is exchanged for labor
and materials. The people doing the Yagya have to practice some
disciplines. The Yagya is not for just one person’s benefit. Nor is
it only for those who are given gifts. It is a daan for animals,
birds, insects, worms, plants, trees, and the entire atmosphere.
This Yagya is called the Daivi sampada.
A Yagya is that, in which our wealth is used to benefit the
elements, plants, and all beings. It includes giving, and practicing
discipline. Daanam damashcha yagyashcha. Keep your senses
controlled and feed others. The ones to be fed are not only people,
nor only Brahmins. You should offer good things to the air, the
sun, and the moon. This is Yagya. Don’t do only Yagya, but also
study. And, examine yourself.
‘Svaadhyaayastapa aarjavam’ – this is the need of a human’s
daily life. These days, people quote science to compare
themselves to animals. They say that we should live a natural life,
like a monkey or donkey. They compare the essence of a human
being to the essence and lifestyle of animals!

Pravachan XX
Cultivate the Daivi Sampada – 3
(Svadhyaya, natimanita)
The description of the Daivi sampada in the Gita is not meant only
for Sadhus (Monks); it is meant for every human being. Observe
this – it is one thing to be a bhakta, Gnani, or Yogi; and it is
another thing to be an ordinary person leading the right kind of
life.
What happens is that when somebody does a little upaasanaa
(devotional worship), he wants everybody to become an upaasaka
(one who does upasana), and starts preaching upasana before his
own is completed. As a result, his upasana is left midway, whether
anyone else becomes an upasak or not!
When a Yogi starts to practice Yoga, he begins to enjoy the
practice. He wants everybody to do Yoga. Similarly, when people
start thinking deeply about spiritual matters, read the ‘Vichara
Sagar’, and savor the Gnan they obtain, they forget their urge for
enlightenment and begin to display the knowledge they have
obtained. However, the upasana, Yoga, and Gnan of such people
are not fulfilled. They first come into the category of social
workers and then they become selfish.
Therefore, the paths of Bhakti, Yoga and Gnan are for a special
purpose, to obtain a particular goal; whereas the ordinary life of a
human being is to remain free of dosha (faults), cultivate good
qualities, and be happy without harming anyone. Our ancient
Shastras are not only for doing bhakti, or Yoga, or getting Gnan.
They also give us Dharma, Artha (worldly success), Kama
(fulfillment of desires) and Moksha (liberation from rebirth). They
describe the four purushaartha (major human achievements), and
include them all.
In the daivee sampadaa (the wealth of divine qualities), there is
the laukik sampadaa (wealth of worldly qualities), and then there
is the aasuree sampadaa (wealth of demonic qualities). The Asuri
258

---

## Page 259

sampada is in those who remain engrossed in sensual pleasures. In
Sanskrit, an ‘asura’ is someone who considers sensual pleasures
to be sukha (happiness); they do not consider shaanti (a mental
state when all urges are at peace) to be sukha. Nor do they accept
sadaachaara (an ethical lifestyle with decorum) to be sukha. I am
telling you one thing – Dharma is a laukik sukha (worldly
happiness). Don’t interpret it wrongly. Just as a person feels
happy when he gets wealth and bhoga (worldly indulgences), a
person gets sukha when he does something that is recommended
by Dharma. Only a few rare people have the good fortune and
insight to realize that the antahkaran (fourfold mind) becomes
limpid when a person does good deeds.
The purpose of Dharma is not only to obtain Swarga (Heaven) or
improve the next life. It is meant to purify this life and give birth
to paramaananda (supreme bliss). Had this not been the case,
Dharma would not be considered a purushartha at all. Purushartha
is that, which we desire – purushaih arthyate` iti purushaarthah’.
The meaning of purushartha has become distorted in Hindi. In
Sanskrit it means, ‘that, which a purusha (human being) desires,
is purushaartha.’ For example, Moksha, Artha and bhoga. In the
same way, Dharma is also a purushartha; meaning, it is something
to be desired.
You feel happy when you get wealth. You feel satisfied when you
get bhoga. You should experience a similar happiness when you
do Dharma, else Dharma would not be a purushartha. Dharma can
also be a saadhana (effort of spiritual progress). If you do Dharma
you will go to Swarga and your next life will be improved.
However, Dharma will not be a purushartha unless you experience
sukha when you do Dharma. The happiness you feel when you
give food and clothes to needy people, or help children to get
education, - or a doctor feels when he gives free treatment to the
poor – that sukha is absolutely pratyaksha (clearly visible). It is
obtained in this very life.
Therefore, to say that Dharma is something that bears fruit only
after death is unacceptable to those who believe Dharma to be a
259

---

## Page 260

purushartha. Those who accept Moksha as a purushartha are of
the same opinion.
I will tell you the opinion of the Vedantis who accept Moksha.
The mokshavaadee (those who believe in Moksha) believe that
the fruit of Dharma is not unseen; meaning, the fruit of Dharma is
not something that can be obtained only after death, in another
realm, or in another lifetime. The fruit of Dharma is given in this
very life. It comes in the form of a purified antahkaran; meaning,
it destroys desire, anger, greed and delusion. Thus, purushartha is
the feeling of happy contentment that can be experienced only
when the antahkaran is pure, and mental distortions are removed.
Had it not been like this, had the person not felt the joy of doing
Dharma, nobody would have wanted Dharma! So, in the opinion
of those who believe in Dharma, Dharma is a purushartha. But in
the opinion of those who believe in Moksha, Dharma is not the
highest purushartha; it gives sukha by purifying the antahkaran.
We should never reject or disdain Dharma.
There are times when we reject Dharma out of fear. Earlier, I used
to live at Kashi. Hindu-Muslim riots would break out suddenly. I
lived in an area that was dominated by Hindus. Oh, God! The
Hindus would say, ‘The Muslims have readied themselves to
attack us tonight. They plan to set fire to our homes. This is what I
have heard. We should get ready to face the attack.’
How should we prepare ourselves?
‘Let us all do kirtan (group singing of devotional songs). We
should keep our lathis (fighting canes) by our side and stay awake
all night.’
The kirtan went on till past midnight. No Muslims came to attack.
People began to wonder how long they should stay up.
‘I am sure that they will attack at four o’clock in the morning,’
said one man. ‘I know their plans. We will face a great deal of
loss and hardship when they set fire to our houses. Why don’t we
attack first, instead of waiting for them to attack?’ This is what
they did.

I am not speaking about the Hindu mentality only. It was the same
with the Muslims. When the mind is filled with fear, people harm
themselves and others. You should remain nirbhay (without fear).
Don’t spoil your present by apprehending frightening possibilities.
As far as possible, have goodwill for all, and go forth as per your
resolve. This is the meaning of ‘gnaanayogavyavasthiti’. Gnan
means the conclusion you have reached, and Yoga means to be
established in your decision, and live accordingly.
Daanam damashcha yagyashcha svaadhyaayastapa aarjavam.
The strength of your shraddhaa (faith) depends upon the strength
of your conviction. You don’t know whether you will live long
enough to use the money you put aside for your old age. Even if
you do, you cannot be sure of being able to use the money. And, if
you are accumulating wealth for others, you may as well forget
about it! So, you should never dishonor wealth.
Kar madhya kapotah ko mayoorah.
If you are given a choice between getting a pigeon today and a
peacock tomorrow, which should you choose? Should you give up
the pigeon and opt for tomorrow’s peacock? No, no! That is
wrong. Today’s pigeon is better than tomorrow’s peacock. Five
rupees in hand are better than tomorrow’s uncertain Kingdom.
Enjoy what you have now. Enjoy the pleasure of doing Dharma,
now. If you cultivate the habit of doing Dharma, you will be a
dharmaatmaa (a person who adheres to Dharma) in future. Unless
the joy of doing Dharma is developed now, you can never be a
dharmatma in future. Once you begin to savor the pleasure of
Dharma, you will always savor it; but if you postpone doing good
deeds, you will not have the habit of getting the happiness of
doing Dharma. You will continue to procrastinate. Dharma is a
purushartha. It should be connected to your wealth and to the
261

desires you have. This is the Dharma for all. It is common to all
human beings.
When King Pururva visited Swarga, he saw the manifested forms
of all the Devtas. He saw Dharma Devta, Artha Devta, and Kama
Devta. Pururva bowed respectfully to Dharma Devta, but he
refused to show respect to Artha Devta and Kama Devta. Both
these Devtas felt offended. Powerful people are quick to take
offence if they are not saluted respectfully!
So, Artha Devta and Kama Devta cursed Pururva. ‘May your
desires never be fulfilled. May you lose all your wealth.’ What
then? Urvashi was pleased with Pururva, and he was entranced by
her; but he was unable to get the sukha of sensual indulgences
because of Kama Devta’s curse.
The effect of Artha Devta’s curse was that Pururva became very
greedy. He was the Monarch of all seven continents, yet he felt
dissatisfied. He collected all the wealth of other people. ‘Let
everybody get an allotted sum of money from the Treasury for
their food,’ he declared. ‘Nobody should have any personal
wealth.’ Pururva snatched away the wealth of all four Varnas
(classes). As a result, people were unable to do a Yagya or any
other religious ritual, because nobody but Pururva had the means
to do any Dharma. This angered the Brahmins. They cursed
Pururva, ‘You will lose all your wealth.’ A greedy person tries to
enslave the Devta of wealth. He wants to control all the wealth.
The Devta of wealth gets displeased with such a person.
I am not giving this lecture for the Sadhus who live in the
wilderness. I am saying this among the Grihastha (married
householders). I want to warn you that if the desires in your life
are not in keeping with Dharma, if your wealth is not used for
Dharma, and according to Dharma, if your Dharma is opposed to
artha and kama, and if you do so much bhoga that your wealth is
exhausted – or focus so much on earning that you have no room
for bhoga or Dharma in your life – then your life will never have
sukha or shaanti (tranquility).
262

May wealth be with you, but may it be combined with Dharma.
May wealth be with you, but let it be for the purpose of sustaining
yourself. Indulge in a way that does not go contrary to Dharma
and artha. Earn, but not at the cost of Dharma and bhoga.
Life should be a blend of all the proper considerations. Daivi
sampada is an example of a samanvita jeevan (a balanced, ethical
life). There is a difference between tyaaga (giving up; sacrifice)
and daana (giving in charity). Tyaga is present in life, and it is a
Daivi sampatti (wealth of divine qualities), and so is daan. The
importance of the object that is given is kept in mind in daan.
‘This is a dear and valuable object. I am giving it to you,’ is daan.
And, ‘This is not needed by me. I am giving it up,’ is tyaga.
In giving up, the object is disdained. It is not considered to be
important or valuable. In daan, however, the object has some
importance and some value. A human being’s life is different
from an animal’s. Animals do not have the discrimination to
think, ‘Is this my wife or someone else’s?’ For them, there is no
difference and no self restraint. They do not recognize
relationships like husband-wife, father-son, etc once they are
grown up. They have no plan to increase their lineage. An
animal’s life does not have Dharma, planning, relationships, self
restraint, or a saattvik vritti (a tendency for lofty ideals). A
human’s life is different from theirs.
You know that if you want to be a bhakta you will have to be
nirmaanamohaa (free of pride and delusion). You recite the
fifteenth chapter of the Gita.
Nirmaanamohaa jitasangadoshaa adhyaatmanityaa
vinivrittakaamaah,
dvandvairvimuktaa sukhadukhasangairgachhantyamoodhaa

conquered the faults of attachments, is constantly established in

the Paramatma, is free of desires, is a Gnani who has risen above
joy and sorrow, and has attained the supreme indestructible state.)
What do you have to do to become a Gnani, and know the
Parabrahm Paramatma?
Amaanitvamadambhitvamahinsaakshaantiraarjavam.
(13. 7)
(Be free of pride and hypocrisy. Don’t cause pain to any. Forgive
people. Be straightforward.)
You will have to give up maana (pride; ego). All right; suppose
you don’t want to become a Gnani, but just want to lead a life of a
decent, upright human being? In that case, you don’t need to be
nirmaana (free of pride) or amaana (egoless). You just have to
save yourself from atimaana (excessive pride). You remember the
things included in the Daivi sampada:
Amaanitvamadambhitvamahinsaakshaantiraarjavam.
(Never cause pain to any by mind, speech or deed. Speak the truth
inoffensively. Don’t get angry with even those who harm you.
Give up the ego of being the doer. Be mentally detached. Don’t let
the mind be restless. Don’t criticize anyone. Be compassionate
always. Don’t get attached to physical comforts and sensual
pleasures. Be gentle. Give up futile attempts and do nothing
shameful. A superior person has a bright personality, is forgiving,
has forbearance, and external purity. He feels no enmity for
anyone, and is free of vanity.)
Do you see the difference amaanitvam (lack of ego) and
naatimaanitaa (not having excessive pride)? The words given are
nirmaana (not having pride) and naatimaanitaa (not having
excessive pride). Amaanitaa (not having ego) is there, but ati
(excess) is added. Have maana (enough pride to have self respect)
264

## Page 265

but not abhimaana (vanity or arrogance). This is the meaning. If
you want to lead a life of ethical decorum, you should not have
excessive pride.
Now, what is this atimaan? There was a Mahatma. People came
and told him, ‘Maharaj, a Yagya is being held. Please come to it.’
The Mahatma went to the place, but he observed that neither the
yajamaana (sponsor) nor the purohita (priest) were inclined to
welcome him with respect. They were engrossed in saying
‘Swaha-swaha’, and continued to offer oblations into the sacred
fire. It is a part of the Dharma of a Yagya to stand up respectfully
to welcome a special guest, even if you are worshipping the
Ishwara or the Parameshwara. A Yagya is a worship of Narayana
Himself. He is more important than any ritual, mantra or purohit.
You can read in the Bhagwat, how Raja Nimi was having a Yagya
and the nine sages called the Nava Yogeshwara came to his
Yagya. Raja Nimi stood up as soon as he saw them. So did the
priests. They lifted up the vessel that held the sacred fire, and
went forward respectfully to greet the sages, carrying the sacred
fire.
No Devta-daani (demigod or donor) is greater than a human
being; the Paramatma manifests in a human being.
So, when the Mahatma saw that neither the yajman nor the purohit
were adhering to the proper decorum, he did not enter the place of
the Yagya, but went and sat on the bank of the Gangaji.
‘What have you done, Maharaj?’ said the people. ‘You came to
grace the Yagya, but did not go inside the place; you came here.
You are doing maan (displaying pride). A sajjan (a person who
leads an ethical life with decorum) should not do maan, but you
are doing maan!’
Look, my brother,’ explained the Mahatma. ‘The Daivi sampada
contains naatimaanitaa. That means, not having excessive pride.
We should not be so arrogant that we humiliate anyone, but we
should have some maan – some self respect. This is also a
maryaadaa (decorum), and decorum should always be
maintained.’
265

## Page 266

What I am saying is that in life, there is a need for artha (material
wealth) and kaama (desire) and maana (self respect) as well. You
cannot live without desires, and you cannot do Dharma if you
don’t have money. Wealth will not endure unless you do Dharma.
Desires cannot be controlled if there is no Dharma, and decorum
cannot be maintained unless there is a little self respect. So, what
is this maan – ‘naatimaanitaa’? Don’t have excessive pride, but
certainly have respect for your country, Dharma, community,
family, and goodwill.
The meaning of amaanitvam is vive`ka (discrimination), and the
meaning of naatimaanitaa is vyavahaara (worldly interaction).
What is the vivek in amanitvam? The discrimination in
amanitvam is how much pride we should have. There is maana (a
degree of self respect), and there is maanee (the one who has
maan), and there is maanitva (having maan); and when all three
are negated, the amanitva is the adviteeya (non-dual) Brahman.
Maan is of three kinds. One is related to space, ‘I am five feet
tall.’ One is related to time, ‘I am eighty years old.’ And, one is
related to matter, ‘I am a wrestler; I am very strong’. Maan is thus
related to time, space, and matter.
Then, there is the pride of the actions done by the body, including
asceticism. There is the pride of being a great scholar, being
highly intelligent, or obtaining a Samadhi. ‘What are worldly
people compared to me? I have attained Samadhi!’ People
become vain when they attain a Samadhi. And, what more can I
say – there is the vanity of nirabhimaana (not being vain)!
There is a gentleman who goes to Satsang (spiritual discourses). If
you invite him to sit on a chair, he says, ‘Maharaj, how can I sit
on a chair at Satsang?’
Very well, sit on the mat.
‘No, no! I am not worthy of sitting amongst you all.’
Then where will you sit?
‘I will sit where you take off your shoes when you enter the hall
for Satsang.’ This gentleman sits at the doorway among the shoes.
He feels that all others sit on a mat or on chairs because they are
266

---

## Page 267

proud, whereas he has no pride and so he sits in the lowliest place!
This is the pride of not having pride! This aadhyaatmik
abhimaana (metaphysical pride) is extremely subtle. People say,
‘I have obtained Bhagwan. I have attained Samadhi. I have great
learning. I have reached great depths of understanding.’ All these
people dance on the axel of pride.
Therefore, the first point is that when we accept the divisions of
space, comparing ourselves with others to their detriment, we
become maanee (having maan), and the feeling of maan is
maanitva. Amaanitva means to use vivek. Tell yourself, ‘There is
no maanitva in me. I have given up all maan. I am not a maanee,
and I have no maanitva.’ If none of these are in you, what are
you? At that moment, you are the Brahman! It is the maanee who
goes to Narak and Swarga (Hell and Heaven). It is the maanee
who is born and dies. It is the maanee who takes on the forms of
animals and birds. Where there is no maan, there is no coming and
going, no birth and death, no becoming a bird or animal. So, the
meaning of amanaitva is that you should use discretion, and
separate your Self from maan, and be established in your essence.
To be one with the Brahman that is beyond Gnan is not
Brahmagnan. It is vivek.
E`tajgnaanamiti proktam agnaanam yadatonyathaa.
(13. 11)
(To be constantly established in metaphysical knowledge and see
the Paramatma, who is the meaning of Tattvagnan, is Gnan; and
whatever is contrary to this, is lack of Gnan.)
What will happen then?
Gne`yam yattatpravaksyaami yajgyaatvamritamashnute`.
(13. 12)
(I will tell you about that, which is worth knowing, and gives
supreme bliss to a human being.)
267

## Page 268

Brahmagnan will say, ‘Oh, you have put aside your maanitva! A
person who has given up even the subtle ego of individuality is
not separate from the Brahman. He is the substratum upon which
maanitva glimmers.’
Yesterday, I was glancing through a book belonging to a
gentleman. It said that this world is not mithyaa (a relative truth);
it is asthaayee (transient), and subject to change. The Atma is
sthaayee (permanent) and Satya (that, which cannot be negated).
The fact is that when you are able to discriminate between the
drashtaa (the Atma that sees) and the drishya (that, which is seen
by the Atma), then both the permanent and the impermanent will
become the drishya. The aatmavastu (the thing that is the Atma) is
separate from the transient world and also form the
superimpositions that seem to be permanent. And, that Atmavastu
is the Brahman.
Thus, amaanitva (absence of the subtle ego of individuality) is a
tangible saadhan (method) for obtaining the Brahman, whereas
naatimaanitaa (lack of excessive pride) is a sadhana for correct
worldly interaction. It is a desirable quality that should be present
in your life.
When you go out, you make sure that your clothes, hair and face
are all neat and clean. How careful you are about your gross body,
when you prepare to interact in the world! Even Sadhus render
service to their bodies, which they consider to be the Brahman.
They smear ash on it with great care. It takes a long time to
prepare the ash. They don’t just use the ash of burnt wood or coal.
They bring leaves of the Bel tree and cook them in milk. Then
they dry, and powder the leaves. This powder shines more than
any face powder you use!
I had seen one Sadhu who would get up every morning and
carefully pluck out the fine strands of hair growing on his
forehead. He wanted to make his forehead look high, to impress
people. He wanted people to consider him a siddha (having
supernatural powers) Mahatma. Thus, you render service to your
gross body when you want to display it before people, but you
268

---

## Page 269

don’t bother about cleansing the subtle body that lies beneath the
cloth of your skin. You are very careful about being well dressed
and well groomed. How careful are you about having a clean
mind?
You know how unhappy you will be if you continue to live and
your loved ones pass away. This is exactly what will happen. You
will continue to exist, but the body that is so dear to you will die.
So, if you give too much importance to your gross body, and get
attached to it, you are preparing to be unhappy. The more attached
you are to your body, the more tears you accumulate for yourself.
You are doing yourself no good.
The Vedas say, ‘Priyam tvaam rotsyati - what you love will make
you weep’. So, Narayana! This subtle body of yours will live on
and the gross body will perish. The gross body does not go before
Yamaraj (the Devta of death); it is the subtle body that goes. The
gross body does not go before the Ishwara either; it is the subtle
body that goes before Him. If your subtle body is unclean, if it is
ugly and filled with deceit, crookedness, treachery, and wrong
urges, you will have to face great suffering. To remove these
faults, and inculcate good qualities is called ‘doshaapanayana’
and ‘gunaadhaana’. The Daivi sampada is meant to inculcate
good qualities, and one of the methods is naatimaanitaa. Don’t
have excessive pride.
One day, I read a newspaper article that analyzed the difference
between abhimaana (vanity; pride) and ahankaara (egoism;
arrogance). When a person says, ‘Do you know how powerful I
am?’ it is abhiman. And, ‘I consider you to be nothing!’ is
ahankar. When your wealth, learning, intelligence, beauty, etc
become a cause of your insulting people, it indicates that the Asuri
sampatti has come into you. We may have the form of a human
being, but at such times, we become Asuras.
I will give you an example of naatimaan. There was a legal
dispute. The accuser went to an elder of the village, asking him to
testify in his favor. ‘My brother, I know nothing about the matter,’
said the Brahmin. ‘How can I testify at all?’
269

---

## Page 270

‘Everything is in your hands, Maharaj,’ said the man. ‘I surrender
myself to you.’ These people who take sharan (surrender) cause
great trouble. You people may not have had this experience, but I
have had a great deal of it. People come and say, ‘Maharaj, I am
in your sharan. You are my only refuge. Please ask somebody to
give me ten thousand rupees for my daughter’s marriage.’ These
people don’t take sharan; they force others to take sharan!
‘Please help me to win my case. You can get anything done! All
you have to do is to say one small lie, which is nothing, really.’
The elderly Brahmin rebuked him sharply. ‘I have children, I have
my Dharma, and I have my good name. You expect me – a
Brahmin – to give a false testimony for your lawsuit?’
The Brahmin showed some abhiman about his caste, but what was
the purpose? It was to protect himself from falsehood. So, this
became naatimaan. It came within the Daivi sampada.
A Brahmin was walking on the road when he encountered a
laborer. ‘Who are you?’ he asked.
‘Maharaj, I am your servant.’
‘What kind of a servant are you? You are a Shudra (of the lowest
caste). Move away from my path. I will have to take a bathe if
your shadow falls on me.’
What is this? This is not naatimaan; it is atimaan – excessive
arrogance. When a Brahmin uses his caste to insult someone who
belongs to a lower caste, it is atimaan, but when he uses his caste
to cultivate good qualities, love of truth and non-violence, his
abhiman becomes his well-wisher. This description of a man who
has Daivi sampada is not meant for a Sadhu or a bhakta; it is to
teach us how a good man who wants to lead an ethical life of
decorum should behave.
Daane` damashcha yagyashcha svaadhyaayastapa aarjavam.
When a human being is born, he brings with him certain rin
(debts). There is the Rishi rin – the debt of the Sages who gave us
Gnan, the Dev rin – the debt of the Devtas who give us the five
270

---

## Page 271

elements and our senses, and there is the Pitri rin – the debt of the
ancestors in whose lineage we are born. I am sure that you are
aware of what I am going to point out, but you are too
preoccupied to give thought to it. You pay house tax to the
Municipality, and you pay for the water that comes into your taps.
You also pay the electricity bills for the lights and fans you use.
But, don’t forget, you don’t only stay at home; you also go out.
You get the light of the sun and the moon, and you get air to
breathe. You use fire to get warmth; you need warmth to stay
alive. You drink water, and you use rain water. Have you ever
paid for these? You have never paid the bill of Vayu (wind)
Devta, or the bills of Agni (fire) Devta, Jala (water) Devta, or
Prithvi (earth) Devta. Every human being is indebted to the Surya
(sun), and the five elements. These debts are called the Devta rin.
It means what you owe to the Devtas.
Have you dropped out of the sky? Have you come into this world
voluntarily? No; you have come through your mother and father.
You stayed in your mother’s womb for nine months. Now, you
and your wife live separately. You should pay rent for the nine or
ten months you spent in your mother’s womb. Pay that bill! Thus,
there is the rin of your mother and the rin of your father, whose
seed was the cause of your inception.
If a farmer sows seeds and reaps the crop, but does not repay the
person from whom he took the seeds, is he not indebted to that
man? Doesn’t he need to repay his debt?
You use words. Tell me any one word that you have created. Even
if you have created some word, you have not created the letters.
This is the Rishi rin – the debt you owe the Rishis.
You learnt to say ‘ma’, ‘ka’, ‘va’, ‘a’, etc. Every syllable you have
learnt has been handed down from generation to generation. You
have come into this world indebted to the Rishis for knowledge,
but what have you done to repay your debts? Which Yagya have
you done to repay the debt of the Devtas? What ritual have you
undertaken to enhance the fragrance of the earth and the
271

---

## Page 272

sweetness of water? Have you done anything to show respect to
the sun and to fire?
A human being is created in three ways – by the seed and blood of
parents, by the worship of Devtas, and by obtaining Gnan. You
will become an aadhyaatmika manushya (metaphysical human)
when you obtain Gnan. You will become an aadhidaivik (divine)
manushya when you worship the Devtas, and you will become an
aadhibhautika (physical) manushya when you serve your parents.
Your physical body will not be fulfilled unless you render service
to your parents. Your latent divinity will not be fulfilled unless
you render service to the Devtas, and your metaphysical potential
will not be fulfilled unless you obtain Gnan.
This Daivi sampada is meant to be inculcated in our life.
Svaadhyaaya - do you study the Shastras? Svadhyay means
studying the portion of the Shatras that the Rishis have allotted to
you. You should definitely read this; read it without fail. I accept
that you have not read a single Shastra, but have you read the
Gayatri? ‘Gaayatreemaatrasaaropi paramamitra’ – svadhyay
also means japa (ritual chanting), it means the Gayatri, and it
means that branch of the Vedas that you belong to. To the best of
my knowledge, there would be many who don’t know how many
branches there are in the Vedas. Do you know which branch you
have been born in, and have a responsibility towards? Do you
come from the Katyayana or Kanva branch of the Vedas? Our
Rishis have given us the responsibility to study our branch of the
Vedas.
There is another interpretation of svadhyay. ‘Sva’ means yourself,
and ‘aadhyaaya’ means to study. Have you every studied your
Self? Are you a puppet made of bones, flesh and skin? Or are you
a puppet that is driven by mental distortions like desire, anger, and
greed? Or, are you a puppet of shaanti-daanti (tranquility and
self-restraint)? Or are you shuddha chaitan (pure consciousness)?
So, to do svadhyay is a Daivi sampada, and this should be a part
of the life of every human being without fail. Only then will you
272

## Page 273

be a true human being. Only then will he latent power of a human
being manifest in you.

Pravachan XXI
Cultivate Daivi Sampada – 4.
(Svadhyay, Tapa, Arjava)
Bhagwan Shri Krishna explained that whatever dosha (faults)
have come into your life or mind should be removed in such a
way that the external influences drop away automatically. Know
that your Self is vast; it is adviteeya (non-dual), so that no raaga-
dve`sha (attachments-aversions) are left in you, for anyone or
anything. Narayana! We can never get separated from our
svaroopa (essence), but what has come from outside can certainly
be detached, because it is not really attached – it just seems to be
attached.
Observe this – you leave everything when you go to sleep. What
objection do you have in letting go of it when you are awake? If
you are prepared for this, you can never be unhappy. You must be
ready for just one thing. Let go, consciously, of all the things you
let go of when you sleep, including your feelings and opinions.
Then you can be established in the Parabrahm Paramatma. You
don’t need to give up anything more than this.
That means, all the Vedanti’s talk about tyaaga (giving up) and
vairaagya (detachment) are not about any great sacrifices that are
beyond your capacity. It is about the tyaga and vairagya you do
every day when you go to sleep. Leave your waking world, and
establish yourself in a dream world. You will experience that
nothing that you believed to be yours, and all that you were
obsessed with, are important enough to cause dukha (sorrow) to
you. This is also what Vedanta says. Dukha is imagined; it is in
the mind. The obvious point in this is that you are a manushya
(human being), and you have the capacity to remove sorrow from
your life. Sorrow is worth removing. You should use saadhan
(effort for spiritual progress) to destroy sorrow. Just accept the
dukha, and as soon as you do so, you will see that your mental
restlessness is calmed. This is its special characteristic. I had read
274

---

## Page 275

a book by an American that said, ‘Hope for the best and be
prepared for the worst.’ I liked that very much.
An Indian Mahatma of ours has said, ‘Be vigilant for the future,
and bend before what happens. It is Bhagwan’s leelaa (frolic).’
The Yogis teach us how to be sukhee (happy). They say, ‘If you
are established in the sat (pure existence), asat (the relative truth)
cannot create sorrow for you.’ Bhaktas teach us, ‘If you are
established in aananda (pure bliss), dukha cannot touch you.’ The
fact is that if we make our consciousness secondary, and merge
into Sat or Ananda, we become free of dukha. In Yoga we reduce
the importance of our consciousness and merge into the sattaa
(pure existence); and in bhakti we reduce the importance of our
consciousness and merge into ananda.
However, che`tanaa (consciousness) cannot be made secondary
for long, because neither existence nor bliss can be known without
it. That is why our Vedantis tell us to be established in the light of
our consciousness. That means, consciousness is your essence.
Know that your essence is unaffected by time and space. It cannot
be separated from you. It is the Brahman. Once you obtain this
Gnan, no separate object can create sorrow for you. Thus, external
karma (actions) are called ‘Dharma’, and internal karmas are
called ‘Yoga’. Inner love is called ‘bhakti’ and love at the deepest
level is called ‘Yoga.’ Tattvagnan (knowledge about the essence
of the Brahman), however, is neither external nor internal; nor
love at the deepest level. Tattvagnan is the essence of the
paramaartha (Supreme). It is the essence of the Atma that is
completely unattached. It is not something that is superimposed.
This is why our Bhagwan Shri Krishna – who has given the Gita
to us – asks how we want sukha. I will refer to a shloka of the
Gita. Do you want to be sukhee (happy) by taking some substance
that induces forgetfulness? Do you want to be happy by deluding
yourself?
I have visited the T.B. hospital at Vrindavan a number of times.
The person I went to meet was hopeful of recovering soon and
doing good business in a year or two. He was full of optimism and
275

the will to live. He refused to accept the reality that he was indeed
very sick. He died that very night! That means, he did not have
even one night more to live, yet he believed that he had a long life
ahead. This is called ‘aatma-sammohan’ – deluding one’s self.
Look; till the very last, Duryodhan refused to accept that he would
lose the war. Bhishma fell, Drona died, Karna died, but
Duryodhan was hopeful that Shalya would win the Mahabharata
war for him. In the same way, we become deluded about our own
bodies and our relatives’ bodies. We have a desire, we begin to
hope that it is fulfilled, then we start believing it to be Satya (that,
which can never be negated), and become so deluded that the
object of our desire causes sorrow and leaves us.
Yadagre` chaanubandhe` cha sukham mohanamaatmanah.

(The sukha that deludes while it is being experienced, and also
results in delusion – like slumber, indolence, and forgetfulness –
is called the Tamas sukha.)
Before and after – yadagre` chaanubandhe` cha – this Tamas
sukha creates moha (delusion). For how long will you stay
deluded? How long will the darkness (of nescience) linger?
Deluded people say, ‘Nobody notices me. I am happy.’ For how
long will you remain unnoticed? ‘I sit with my eyes shut. I will
not see the external world at all, so I will be happy.’ That is
absolutely wrong.
Someone may say, ‘I will be happy by letting my senses indulge
in sense objects. I will always gaze at my wife, husband, father, or
son.’ Well, where there is a vishay (object of the senses) – like, ‘I
will always have my favorite dishes’ – will your taste always
remain unchanged? You don’t realize that it is wrong to think that
you will be able to obtain and enjoy the things you like, or the
people and wealth you love. The accumulation of the sense
276

objects, the things you love to have, the indulgences you enjoy,
and the imagined life with people, are all transient.
What I am about to say will be bitter to hear, but I say it because it
will leave some sanskaara (subtle subconscious impressions) that
will benefit you. You think that you will die while doing your
maalaa (rosary). The mala will move in your hand, while the
tongue says Bhagwan’s name. All this is atma-sammoha. You
should know – or you should do the sadhana – that if your tongue
and mala don’t move at the time of death, or if you are unable to
meditate on Bhagwan, it will not make any difference to your
obtaining the Paramartha.
So, don’t live a life filled with abhimaana (pride, ego), conscious
of your worldly wealth and contacts. You can never depend upon
anything in this world, because things can be stolen, or
confiscated by the King, Police, Income Tax, or some other law.
And, people have their own praarabdha (fate created by actions
of past lives). Nobody is born with anybody else’s prarabdha.
Every creature brings his own quota of food and comfort.
What you imagine for the future is like anticipating the movement
of an ant. The ant may go in a straight line, turn aside or turn
back, or, it may fall. You inculcate some habits, but these habits
will continue as long as your limbs are active and within your
control. You may do Yogic exercises like the Surya Namaskara or
Sheershasana, but only as long as you have the physical strength
to do them. If you hope to save yourself from dukha through
worldly objects, indulgences, day dreams, and habits, you are
making a great mistake.
I have drawn your attention to three kinds of sukha – the sukha
obtained through delusion, through sensual indulgences, and
through habits or objects. None of these can give lasting
happiness. In the opinion of the Gita, the real sukha is the one our
Bhagwan Shri Krishna tells us about. See what He says:
Sukhamaatyantikam yattadbuddhigraahyamateendriyam,
ve`tti yatra na chaivaayam sthitashchalati tattvatah.

Yam labdhvaa chaaparam laabham manyate` naadhikam tatah,

Tam vidyaaddukhasanyogaviyogam yogasangnitam,

(6. 21, 22, 23)
(The infinite bliss is beyond the senses. It is grasped by the subtle
intellect. A Yogi obtains this when he reaches a certain stage, and
then he is never shaken from that state.
Know that there is no greater gain than that of obtaining the
Paramatma. A Yogi who reaches the state of obtaining the
Paramatma is not shaken by even the greatest cause for sorrow.
You should know what Yoga is. It is free of any attachments to
this world, which is nothing but sorrow. This Yoga should
definitely be undertaken with enthusiasm and a tranquil mind.)
If the cause of your sukha is a habit, like doing puja, it will end
when you are not able to continue the activity that gives you
happiness. This is why the word aattyantik (that which never
ends) is used. And, if the sukha is restricted to a particular place,
or your feeling for something, it will end when your feelings
change. Therefore, true happiness is not created by mental
inclinations. The sukha created by sensual pleasures is temporary.
Therefore, real sukha is beyond the senses – it is ateendriya.
Ateendriya – the pleasure derived by the senses is connected to
the sense objects that are subject to destruction; and the power of
the senses is also limited. So ateendriya sukha should be such that
it does not depend upon the senses and sense objects. Meaning,
your happiness should not depend upon your getting the food you
like, the indulgences you crave, or any particular person.
You have entangled yourself in the net of your imagination. Your
sukha should be independent of your senses and their objects. The
sukha of Rajo guna (the mixed tendency that is filled with worldly
considerations) is different from the ateendriya sukha, and the
buddhigraahya sukha (the happiness derived through the intellect)
is different from the sukha that is derived through delusion.
278

Your understanding should be awake and alert. And, the
sukhamaatyantikam - the aatyantik sukha that does not end – lies
beyond even the aadhyaatmik (metaphysical) sukha and the
saattvik sukha (the sukha of Sattvik activities that leads to peace
and spiritual progress) obtained through good habits. The
ateendriya sukha is different from the temporary sukha of the
senses. What is born will die, whether it is today or tomorrow.
The sukha that Bhagwan Shri Krishna wants to give you does not
depend on sensual pleasures, mental activities, or good habits.
These are obtained through the three gunas (tendencies; the lofty
tendency of Sattva, the mixed tendency of Rajas and the lowly
tendency of Tamas). The sukha Shri Krishna wants you to get is
beyond the three gunas; it is ateendriya. If you think that you can
create such a sukha, please go ahead. If not, you must move your
mind away from the transient worldly happiness.
Your mind has been ruling over you since your early childhood. It
has become your master. You have not listened to your Gnan, you
have listened to your mind. You did not do what the Shastras said,
you did what your mind said. You followed your mind instead of
following the Ishwara or Dharma. You have spoilt the habits of
your mind, and now it refuses to obey your orders.
I am telling you about the anguish in my heart. Modern
psychologists will disagree, but the moment of a human being’s
greatest good fortune is when he is able to rule over his mind, and
discipline it. Your mind orders you around as though you are its
slave. You have to make it healthy and obedient. And, for this,
you will have to inculcate the daivee sampadaa (the wealth of
divine qualities) into your life.
One Shastra says, ‘Why does a person grow old?’ People don’t
want to grow old, but why do they age? The answer given is that a
man becomes old when he eats before the food in his stomach is
digested fully. He also ages if he starves himself after his meal has
been digested. That means, our eating habits should be according
to what our Mother Gita tells us, what Bhagwan Shri Krishna tells
us. Study the bhoga (indulgences) you do. Study your karma
279

(actions). What do you say? How do you speak? Do you show
respect to the Devtas? I am telling you about minute points.
Earlier, people would go to Swargashram to do Satsang (listen to
spiritual discourses). They would bathe in the Gangaji. Many
would relieve themselves in the Gangaji, or on the banks of the
river. They would brush their teeth and make the whole area dirty.
Seth Jaydayalji used to spend ten minutes of his daily lectures to
convince people not to do this.
Even modern, educated people who live in the cities spit on the
roads. Are you showing respect to Dharati Mata (Mother Earth)?
This Dharati is a Devta. You use the light of the Surya (sun)
Devta, but do not offer a handful of water as a worship, because
you don’t want to wake up early.
You use agni (fire) all the time, but can’t do homa (fire worship).
Our Gita’s Bhagwan tells us to respect the Devtas because it will
strengthen our senses. The Prithvi (Earth) gives us fragrance.
Agni gives energy, the sun gives light, the moon delights, and the
wind gives you air to breathe. If you don’t cultivate the habit of
giving something to those from whom you get something, you
will behave in the same selfish way with people. You will say, ‘It
is their duty to give me food. So what if they fed me?’
I will tell you a little story. It is a very short story. Don’t get upset
if it doesn’t appeal to you! Indra came to know that Karna had a
kavacha (invincible armor). ‘How will my son Arjuna kill Karna
in battle?’ thought Indra. He knew that it was Karna custom to not
deny anything to a Brahmin or any other supplicant who asked for
any daan (charity) when Karna came out after completing his bath
and puja. So he dressed as a Brahmin and asked Karna for his
kavach. Karna was born with the kavach attached to his body like
a second skin. Still, he took a knife and pierced it in places. He
took it off, and gave it to Indra.
Indra began to leave with his precious gift, but his feet stuck to the
ground. He felt frightened. He had come to ask for the kavach, to
ensure his son’s victory, but he was defeated. He didn’t know
what to do. There was an aakaashvaani (a celestial voice). ‘Indra!
280

## Page 281

You have taken a lot from Karna, but given nothing in return. This
is why your movement is stalled. You will not be able to go forth
until you give something to Karna. It is the principle that you have
to give something in return of what you take. You will be able to
proceed only after you have given something to Karna in return of
what you have taken.’
Indra gave Karna a skakti (a divine power to be used as a
weapon), and only then was he able to go on his way. What I wish
to say is that you take so much from the Devtas, but what do you
give in return? Please give this some thought.
You think that you lead an excellent life. ‘Who is as well dressed
and well groomed as I? Who talks as skillfully as I do?’ This
manushya (human) is full of ingratitude. He takes so much from
Creation but what does he do in return? He spits and evacuates,
dirtying the place wherever he goes. He pollutes the earth,
brightness, air, and water. He gives dirt in return of all he takes,
and then he thinks that his lifestyle is excellent!
A dvija (Brahmin) gives sanskaara (subtle subconscious
impressions created through rituals) that your intake should be
pure and in keeping with Dharma. If a baby is born to a prostitute,
will there be any garbhaadhaana sanskaara (the ritual done when
the husband implants his seed in his wife’s womb)? The purpose
of sanskara is that the child to be born should be inclined towards
Dharma. We should have respect for these sanskara rituals.
The Guru gives us the path to the Paramartha (Supreme); we
should have respect for him. The learned sages increase our
intellectual capacity and give us wisdom. They give us guidance
about dealing with problems. It is our Dharma to show respect to
them all. If you honor the ones from whom you get something,
you will receive more and more wisdom in return.
De`vadvijapraagnapoojanam.
(17. 14)
(You should worship the Devtas, Brahmins, and learned people.)
281

---

## Page 282

This is your kartavya (duty) towards others. Now, what is your
duty towards yourself? It is to keep your body and mind pure.
And your duty towards your ahankaara (subtle ego of
individuality) is aarjavam – to be straightforward. Don’t be
deceitful. Maintain the brahmacharya (celibacy) as per the rules
for a grihastha (married householder), and do not cause sorrow to
any. See what the Gita says – ‘svaadhaayastapa aarjavam’. Let
tapa (asceticism) rise in your life. ‘De`vadvijagurupoojanam’ –
this is also tapa, and it is related to your daily life. The dvijas give
you so many sanskaras throughout your life. You have an
obligation towards them. You also have an obligation towards the
Devtas who give strength to your senses, towards the Gurus and
the learned people who show you the path to the Paramartha, and
teach you how to face problems. How can you be happy if you
don’t show respect to them? You need to respect them to make
you life happy.
Now comes speech. How should you speak? There is a gentleman
who is extremely careful that his son should have all the good
sanskaras. He once had to go out of town for eight days. His son
began to play with lowly people while he was away. When he
returned, he heard the child use bad words. ‘Where did you learn
these words?’ he asked.
So, pay attention to what you say and how you speak. Does your
speech reveal the anand (joyfulness) that is within you, or is it a
cause of agitation? There are people who boast about how they
rebuked someone or humiliated him. This is a tendency of hinsaa
(violence) of the vaanee (speech). Just as a mother teaches her
child to talk, Shri Krishna teaches us the art of proper speech.
Anudve`gakaram vaakyam satyam priyahitam cha yat,
svaadhyaayaabhyasanam chaiva vaangmayam tapa uchhyate`.
(17. 15)
(The tapa of speech is speech that does not agitate, is pleasant to
hear, beneficial and truthful. It includes reciting the Vedas and
chanting Bhagwan’s name.)
282

## Page 283

Make yourself endure the tapa of self-restraint. Why do you try to
hurt others? A person who inflicts pain on another always suffers.
An Acharya of Ayur Veda says, ‘Your body will not succumb to
disease if you improve your speech.’ When you shoot arrows of
harsh words with an intention to inflict pain, it has a reaction on
you. When anger prompts you to hurt another, you set fire to your
heart, burn your tongue, and use harsh words – and the other
person is burnt by your anger. You cannot be happy when you
harass anyone.
So, how should you speak?
The experts on Ayur Veda say, ‘Speak the truth.’ They say that
you have to use a lot of strength to cover up for every single lie.
You may say one untruth first, and seventy more to cover up that
one untruth. This imposes a great strain on you. You can refrain
from saying anything, because you are not bound to speak even
the truth.
It is written in the Manusmriti, ‘If an unmarried girl becomes
pregnant, don’t tell her father about it in public. You will have
spoken the truth, but you also insult him publicly. His reputation
will be effected.’ Causing unhappiness is a hinsaa (violence). To
be abrasive and tactless is not being truthful. Speak the truth, but
refrain from saying things that hurt other people. On the one hand,
it is a good quality to be truthful, but on the other hand it is a sin
to hurt anyone by using the truth as a weapon.
Satyam brooyaat priyam brooyaat, na brooyaat satyamapriyam.
(Speak the truth and speak with sweetness. Don’t speak the truth
that is hurtful for someone.)
This shloka is written by Manuji. If somebody’s unmarried
daughter becomes pregnant, that is not something to be
announced! The Masters of Ayur Veda tell you that you will not
fall ill if you speak the truth. Say things that are beneficial. If you
want to talk to someone, say things that will benefit him, and not
what is favorable for you.

A gentleman came to see me. He is a lawyer from Itava and quite
a learned man. He started by talking about ghosts and spirits.
When he saw that I had no interest in this topic, he started to talk
about other things, including the Brahman. For three hours I
listened to his prattle out of politeness. He behaved as though I
had nothing to do but to entertain him! After three hours, he
bowed down to me and prepared to leave, but came back from the
doorway, saying, ‘Oh, Swamiji, I forgot to mention one thing.’
What did you forget?
‘The J.K. family has about an acre of land next to my house. It
will be very helpful to me if they give this land to me. Please ask
them to gift me this land.’
‘Did you forget to say this to me?’ I asked. ‘You should have
mentioned it as soon as you came. Our talk would have been over
in fifteen minutes! Why did you waste my time and yours, talking
about spirits and ghosts and mantras and yantras? You should
have told me straight what you wanted.’ Thus, he wasted three
hours of mine for a small benefit for himself.
Speak satya, speak priya (pleasant), speak hita (that, which
benefits), speak mita (in brief), and speak avasarochita
(appropriate to the occasion). There is a lady who comes to meet
me. She usually comes at lunchtime. She talks about her
grandmother and her aunt, and her son who got drunk and
vomited! Her talk spoils the taste of my food. Why should she tell
me about the things that are of no interest to me?
Your speech should be pleasant as well as truthful. It should be
beneficial but brief. You should say what is suitable for the
moment. Speak if you need to say something, or if someone is
likely to be harmed unless you speak. Avoid unnecessary talk.
‘Boliye` to taba jaba boliye` kee reeti jaano’. (Speak when you
have learnt how you should speak.)
Our Acharyas of Ayur Veda tell us that we should not get into an
argument about something that we are not sure about. One man
came and announced that he had heard that an air plane had
284

---

## Page 285

crashed and a hundred people had been killed. There was no need
for him to talk about what was just a rumor.
If you are sure about the accuracy of your information, there is no
harm in giving people the information, but you should not help to
spread rumors. When a person is careful about his speech, his
longevity is increased and he remains healthy. The experts on
Ayur Veda explain that we should avoid saying anything that will
create disease in our body – anudve`gakaram vaakyam. Don’t say
anything that causes agitation or fear.
Speech should have the qualities of truthfulness and sweetness.
Someone may say, ‘What can I do, Maharaj? My tongue doesn’t
obey me. I have fallen into the habit of deviating from the truth
and being sarcastic.’ You can change this habit though doing
svadhyay and japa. How many people are there who have the
habit of speaking properly? What should be done is a different
matter. What should be eaten is a different matter. To eat you
have to take in something from outside. To do something you
have to exert yourself. In speaking, however, you don’t have to
take anything from outside or exert yourself very much. Even so,
you should certainly learn to examine yourself. You need to know
yourself. Svadhyay is to know what you should say and what you
should do. Why don’t you learn this from the Gita?
Be careful about one thing – your smile should never leave your
lips. Your smile should be a close friend of your countenance.
Your eyes and your smile should be fast friends. You should
always have a smiling face. What is a smile? The purity and
goodwill of our heart is revealed through our smile and eyes.
There is a description about Shri Ramachandra’s behavior when
anyone came to meet Him. He would be the first to smile and say
words of welcome. He did not sit gravely with lowered eyes,
waiting for the other person to salute Him; He would smile and
say welcoming words before the visitor said anything. This is how
we should behave.
There are many descriptions in the Bhagwat about how we should
speak. ‘Saar sushtum mitam madhu.’ If I were to talk like
285

---

## Page 286

villagers talk, it would not appeal to city dwellers. If I were to use
lots of Sanskrit words, most of the people would not understand
what I mean. Thus, our speech should be at a middle level, neither
too rustic nor too difficult. We should always speak smilingly and
with a clean heart. Have no feeling of ill-will, hatred, or
deviousness – manahprasAada.
Saumyatvam – be straightforward when you talk. Don’t have any
crooked intentions. Shopkeepers welcome customers cordially
and offer them coca-cola. Their intention is to make a profit. This
selfish attitude should not be there in your life.
Just as there is a mauna (silence) of speech, there is also a mauna
of the mind. You waste your mental power imagining what people
may do, what Russia and America may do. You make your mind
go round and round in futile thoughts. Focus your mind on your
goal and keep your feelings pure.

Pravachan XXII
Develop the Daivi Sampada – 5
(Ahinsa, Satya, Akrodha, Adroha)
Give your attention to the Daivi sampatti – adroha (absence of
rebellion), akrodha (absence of anger), ahinsaa (absence of
violence) – all three are given together.
Ahinsaasatyamakrodhastyaagah shaantirapaishunam,
dayaa bhoote`shvaloluptvam maardavam hreerachaapalam.
Te`jah kshamaa dhritih shauchamadroho naatimaaitaa.
(16. 2. 3)
(Do not hurt anyone with your mind, speech or body. Speak the
truth and speak pleasantly. Don’t get angry with even those who
hurt you. Give up the subtle ego of being the doer of your actions.
Free your mind from worldly considerations, so that it becomes
tranquil. Have compassion and selfless goodwill for all creatures.
Don’t get attached to sense objects, even if you indulge in them.
Be gentle. Feel ashamed to do anything that is against Dharma or
society. Give up all unnecessary efforts.
Have an inner strength. Be forgiving. Have forbearance and also
external purity. Have no enmity towards anybody. Never feel that
you deserve to be honored.)
What is adroha? What is akrodha? And, what is ahinsa? Salesmen
know the quality of the cloth they sell. They know which is of fine
quality and which is coarse; which is expensive and which is
cheap. An ordinary customer will not be able to distinguish easily.
If you are a customer of the Daivi sampada, you will have to
understand what akrodha is, what ahinsa is, and what adroha is.
Then, I will tell you about the five yama (internal self-restraint;
the first step in Yoga.)
Satya (truthfulness), ahinsaa (non-violence), aste`ya (not coveting
what does not belong to you), brahmacharya (celibacy as per the
287

---

## Page 288

rules of the four stages of life), and aparigraha (not accumulating
unnecessary possessions), are the five yamas. Here, we speak
about ‘ahinsaasatyamakrodhah’ Measure yourself. How dear is
satya to you? How can you be the Paramatma’s pre`mee (lover) if
you are not a lover of the truth? Your mind is not the most
important thing.
Look; the function of satya is to save you from falsehood. The
function of ahinsa is to save you from anger. The function of
asteya is to stop you from stealing. Brahmacharya protects you
from being enslaved by lust, and aparigraha saves you from
excessive hoarding.
Now, there are five thieves – falsehood, violence, thievery, lust,
and hoarding. The purpose of the five yamas is to save you from
these five dosha (faults). However, stealing and hoarding are not
really two – they are the same fault, and the name of this fault is
‘lobha’ (greed). This dosha – greed – is so strong that it needs two
wrestlers (asteya and aparigraha) to control it.
Lobha comes in two forms. One is to take the wealth that belongs
to another, and the other is to accumulate a great deal of wealth
and not give it to anyone. Two out of five yamas are needed to
remove the fault of greed. Both asteya and aparigraha should
come into our life. Only then will we be on the path of the Daivi
sampada.
I want to tell you one point about akrodha. Adroha, akrodha,
ahinsa – you get krodha (anger). Anger takes you to hinsaa
(violence), and violence takes you to droha (revolt). At the root of
these is ahankaara (pride), and pride gives shelter to dve`sha
(hatred). Dvesha leads to krodha, which leads to hinsa, and hinsa
takes on the form of droha.
Ahinsaasatyamakrodhastyaagah shaantirapaishunam.
Our greatness, our ‘I’ (Atma) infiltrates into all these. You know
that pride is because of agnaana (ignorance; lack of Gnan) about
the Parabrahm Paramatma. According to Vedanta, agnan and
288

---

## Page 289

bhraanti (mistaken understanding) are two different things. For
example, this book is lying here. Agnan is to not know which
book it is, and bhranti is to think that it is something else, maybe a
piece of cloth. Thus, it is agnan to not know that you are the
Paramatma, and bhranti is to think that you are a jeeva (Atma
attached to a body). And, raaga (attachment) always stays with a
jeeva. And, when you have raga for one, you will get dvesha for
another.
What is dvesha? It is an inclination that burns. Your heart starts
burning when you see someone, hear about him, or see how he
lives. When this happens, you will know that dvesha has arrived.
Krodha comes along with dvesha. Krodha is something that shuts
the doors of sukha (happiness). Sukha and shaanti (peace) cannot
enter the mind as long as anger is there. ‘Ashaantasya kutah
sukham’ – how can anyone whose mind is ashaanta (lacking
shanti) ever be at peace?
Consider this – when anger comes into your speech or hand, and a
plan is made to beat someone, it is called ‘hinsa’. And when you
arouse other people to join you in doing violence to your enemy,
it becomes droha. It becomes a revolt when you arouse others to
be violent. The burning of the heart that precedes this is called
hatred, and it all stems from pride. Pride is because of faulty
understanding, and faulty understanding is because you don’t
know the Paramatma.
Your mind is like a book. Turn the pages of this book. This is
what I am telling you about. The effect of hinsa is visible. A few
days back I was going somewhere from Kashi. We have to go
upstream for some distance to get a boat. A large number of
people had got onto the boat. One policeman came, and said that
some people should get off, because the boat was overloaded.
Two Sadhus were sitting in the boat. One of them said, ‘We were
the first to get onto the boat. It was quite empty when we came, so
we have a right to go across. We will not get off.’ This enraged
the policeman and he hit the nearest Sadhu with his cane. The
289

---

## Page 290

Sadhu said nothing; nor did he get off the boat. Ultimately the
boat pushed off without anyone getting off.
The Sadhu who had spoken told his companion, ‘This man beat
you unjustly! You should have told him something! You may not
retaliate with blows, but you can at least say some sharp words in
reply!’ The Sadhu remained silent. He just smiled. A Sadhu’s
nature has kshamaa (forgiveness). Kshama is a Daivi sampatti.
The behavior of a Satpurush (person with divine qualities)
towards an offender is called kshama. And, the characteristic of a
person who has Asuri sampada is to hurl a stone in retaliation of a
stone, or say harsh words when harsh words are said to him. This
is not the characteristic of a person with Daivi sampada.
If someone wishes you ill and you also begin to wish ill for him,
then the very dosha you saw in him has come into you, has it not?
Now, about a hundred people were in that boat. The boat bumped
into the Ramnagar Fort. Iron rods protruded from the Fort. As
people watched, one of the rods pierced the policeman in his
stomach. He was left impaled on it as the boat swept downstream.
Saadhu avagyaa kara fala e`saa, jarai nagara anaatha kara
jaisaa,
saadhu avagyaa turata bhavaanee, kara kalyaana akhila kai
haanee.
(Insulting a Sadhu results in great, immediate harm.)
The non-violence of the Sadhu remained unaffected, but Prakriti
(Nature) turned violent in reaction to the unjust violence. So, you
see when rebellion is there, people instigate others to rebel
violently. When violence is there, our hands, feet and mouth
become active in opposing someone. And, when anger enters, it
burns our mind. If you want to have Daivi sampada, don’t you
want to overcome these faults? Do you want to let things carry on
as they are?
People sit on an armchair in an air-conditioned room. ‘Let
whatever comes into my mind come.’ This is possible. But, it is
290

---

## Page 291

not possible to interact with others with the attitude, ‘Let whatever
happens, happen.’ When you interact with others, you need a little
Daivi sampada. It is like having some money with you when you
go on a journey. You should definitely carry some money with
you when you travel. This is called ‘sampadaa’ (wealth). Your car
may break down, you may have to buy some food, or give some
help to someone. Similarly, when you interact, you should have
the wealth of goodwill, the Daivi sampatti.
People say, ‘My mind, my mind, my mind!’ They worship their
mind and forget to worship Bhagwan. It is necessary to suppress
our mind at times, but this, too has to be learnt. People say, ‘My
brother, the thought came to me and I spoke it aloud. I felt like
abusing the man, so I used foul language.’ Believe me, this is
madness! ‘I felt like eating it, so I ate it.’ It is a sign of insanity to
blindly follow every impulse of the mind. It is not the sign of a
person who is a lover of satya. The mind must be kept under
control.
Why does anger come to your mind? Agnan is at the root of
anger. Agnan causes faulty understanding, and that leads to pride.
Pride leads to hatred, hatred leads to anger, anger leads to
violence, and violence leads to revolt. So, why do you get angry?
You get angry when things don’t go the way you want.
Kaama (desire) causes krodha (anger). Had there been no desire
in you, about the behavior of a child, woman or neighbor, you
would not get angry. You cannot behave the way others want, yet
you want them to behave as you want! Desire is strong in you, and
that is why you get angry.
Another point is that the tapasvee (ascetics) tend to be hot
tempered. That is also because of pride. I know a gentleman who
has done several rituals of the chanting of the Gayatri Mantra
twenty four lakh times per ritual. He is so hot tempered that even
people who live a hundred miles away call him ‘Durvasaji’. He is
a brahmachari (avowed celibate). The rituals he has undertaken
are, indeed, praiseworthy. He boasts about his worship and takes
offence if someone does not obey him. Therefore, when desire
291

---

## Page 292

becomes predominant it gives rise to anger. You have read in the
Gita –
Kaamaat krodhobhijaayate`.
(2. 62)
(Anger is created by desire.)
What is the name of krodha’s father? It is kama. When a desire
rises, there are two results. Desire has two offspring. Lobha
(greed) is born when desire is fulfilled, and krodha is born when
desire is thwarted. Desire gives birth to greed and anger. Kama is
Raktabeej (a demon, whose every drop of blood became a demon,
until the goddess Durga killed him by drinking his blood before it
touched the ground). The more it bleeds, the more its progeny
increase.
When somebody gives up or destroys many external desires, it
gives rise to many internal desires. When these are not fulfilled,
he becomes frustrated and angry. In Sanskrit, the word ‘krodha’ is
analyzed this – ‘Krodhah kasmaat? Kam sukham e`natti-iti.’ Why
is krodha called krodha? It is because it blocks the stream of peace
and happiness that flows into our heart constantly. It blocks the
opening of the Sushumna (the central channel of subtle energy
that runs parallel to the spine). The opening gets blocked when the
scales of raga-dvesha get disbalanced. When the flow of the Ida
and Pingla (the two channels of subtle energy on either side of the
Sushumna) are restricted, the opening is blocked.
What is this chhidra (opening)? There is an opening from the
Brahmarandhra (the energy center at the crown of the head) from
which amrita (nectar) drips constantly. ‘Rasa gagana gufaamein
ajara jhare`’ – rasa (sweetness) drips constantly in the cave of the
sky. But as soon as krodha enters the mind, and the scales (of
equanimity) are disbalanced, the spring is blocked. An angry man
cannot be happy; nor are the progeny of anger good. Krodha has
been born in the lineage of kama; its very lineage is bad! It
destroys sukha as soon as it comes.
292

## Page 293

What else does krodha do when it arrives? Perhaps you people
have not succumbed to anger, but I have experienced it. My limbs
began to tremble. If you are overcome by anger you will not be
able to hit anyone or wrestle with anyone. Your limbs become
weak and you lose clarity of thought.
There was a Thakur Sahib in the Gazipur District. He was
involved in a Court case. The lawyer of his opponent realized that
it would be impossible to trap him into saying anything
detrimental to his case. Thakur Sahib was a very learned man with
a good knowledge of law. The lawyer tried to make him lose his
temper during cross examination. Thakur Sahib was a
straightforward man who did everything very thoroughly. He was
the most learned person in that entire region at that time. He had
been the Chairman of the Gazipur and Varanasi districts. He was a
Member of Parliament. He had been the Manager of a number of
large companies in the past, but he was simple and
straightforward. He looked like a simple villager.
However, when the lawyer pestered him impudently, he got
irritated and said, ‘Why are you trying to trap me? I can teach you
law for ten years more!’ The lawyer at once asked for this
statement to be noted. ‘Your Honor, he is such a clever man that
he can teach me law for ten years more. He cannot bear it if his
point is not established.’
When anger overcomes a man, even a wise man behaves like a
fool. When wrestlers lose their temper, their limbs begin to
tremble. They have to go and sit on one side to regain their cool.
Anger makes the blood boil. A man is not himself when he loses
his temper.
How can anger be conquered? One point is that people are so
quick to think that they have been insulted. I did not know the
word ‘insult’ earlier. I learnt it when I came in touch with you, the
city dwellers. This is at the root of anger. A retired Judge was
traveling to Allahabad by train. Another man come into the
compartment and asked him to shift his bedding, since he wanted
293

---

## Page 294

to put his own bedding there. The newcomer said haughtily, ‘Do
you know that I am a Judge?’
‘Do you know that I am the father of a Judge?’ asked the old man.
Now, when the train reached Allahabad, the son of the old man,
who was also a Judge, came to receive his father. The father
introduced him to his traveling companion. The retired Judge said,
‘I did not tell you a lie! You got annoyed and told me that you
were a Judge, but I spoke the truth when I told you that I am the
father of a Judge.’ The two young Judges became good friends.
Thus, the best way to control your anger is to obtain the Gnan that
nothing exists except the Paramatma. This knowledge is called
Brahmagnan. No matter what happens, you feel that all is well.
Enjoy the extraordinary sukha of jeevanmukti (being free of
worldly cares). This is the best way to live.
Now see another point – if Bhagwan’s bhakti comes into your
heart, and you begin to see Bhagwan in all – ‘This is Shyam! This
is Shyam! Here is Shyam!’ you will be happy.
The third point is, all Creation is ruled by Prakriti (Nature), or the
Ishwara, or circumstances, or our antahkaran (fourfold mind).
When a slave, who has no free will, says something wrong, you
should not get angry with him. There was a gentleman. One man
would abuse him with bad words every day. Being a cultured
man, he could not bring himself to retaliate. He called the village
ruffian and told him, ‘I will give you ten rupees a day to give a
fitting reply to this man.’ When the ruffian came to face the man,
the man said, ‘This man is a hired slave. I refuse to talk to him.’
Thus, the people of this world are governed by Prakriti; they are
driven by their nature. They are controlled by the Ishwara, or their
praarabdha (fate created by past actions), or their sanskaara
(subtle subconscious impressions). There is no need to lose your
temper if they do something wrong. This is one way of looking at
things.
The viewpoint of the Brahman, the viewpoint of the Ishwara, the
viewpoint of circumstances, the viewpoint of karma or prarabdha
– all these are different ways of looking at the things that happen.
294

## Page 295

Now, see the Dharma drishti (viewpoint). Examine yourself.
Measure yourself, instead of measuring others. Don’t think, Why
does he not behave according to Dharma?’ See whether your own
behavior is according to Dharma. The essence of Dharma is:
Na tat parasya sandigdham pratokoolam yadaatmanah.
Anything that gives you pain will definitely give pain to another.
There is no doubt about this. It hurts us when anyone abuses us,
so if we abuse them, it is bound to hurt them. It pains us if
someone steals our money, so if we steal anyone else’s money, it
will surely pain them. So –
Na tat parasya sandigdham pratikoolam yadaatmanah,
shrooyataam dharmasarvasvam shrutvaa chaivaavadheeyataam,
aatmanah pratikoolaani pare`shaam na samaachare`t.
We feel bad when someone harms us, abuses us, says lies to us, or
misbehaves with our womenfolk. Won’t others feel bad if we do
the same? Won’t we be at fault? Only half-baked Vedantis
indulge in this. I will give you an example of what immature
Vedantis are like. They say, ‘We can do whatever we like,
because we are Vedantis. We are Gnani, so we incur no paapa-
punya (sin-spiritual merit).’ He is an akartaa (not the doer), he is
an abhoktaa (not the one who enjoys or suffers), he is an agnaani
(one who lacks Gnan). He does not have the right to say such
things. He is what is called a kuchhaa-bachhaa (raw-immature)
Vedanti.
Therefore, if you want to overcome anger, the viewpoint of
Dharma is that you should not to do to others what you don’t want
them to do to you. If you want your husband to listen to you, start
listening to him. You will see that there is no need for any
disagreement or anger.
So, my brother, listen to others if you want them to listen to you.
Chat with your husband for six hours, but spend an hour chatting
295

---

## Page 296

with your mother-in-law, too. Let her also have your company.
What I mean to say is that when people try to do only what they
feel like doing, their heart starts burning. Whatever Bhagwan does
is for your good. We fail to recognize this because of our strong
urges, our attachments and delusions.
A gentleman came to me – either yesterday or the day before.
‘Maharaj’, he said, ‘please convince me that Bhagwan is merciful,
that He does shower Grace. I am unable to feel this.’ The
gentleman may be sitting here. I don’t know if he has come. There
are many people present and he may be among them.
Now, had I wanted, I could easily have given him any number of
reasons to convince him that whatever Bhagwan does is good.
The problem is that you want the Ishwara to be a slave of your
desires. You want Him to do whatever you say. The Ishwara
should do the work, but the buddhi (brains) should be yours. And,
when the Ishwara does not do what you think He should, He
should have kripaa (Grace). You have the buddhi, but not the
kripa, so the Ishwara should do kripa as per your buddhi! Isn’t this
what you want?
I could easily have told the man all this, but instead I said, ‘Look;
we are all nirgunee (believing in the Brahman without attributes).
We don’t give much importance to whether Bhagwan does kripa
or not, so why should I enter into a lengthy discussion with you?
Your own Maharaj has come. He is very knowledgeable on the
Gita. Go and ask him. He will give a very good answer to your
question. He can explain about the Ishwara’s justice and kripa.’
The man said, ‘Maharaj, I had gone to him a year ago. When I
began to argue with him, he dismissed me, saying that he held no
brief to convince people about Bhagwan’s kripa!’ The Mahatma is
not to blame!
Now, take a look at krodha. Krodha comes even at the Ishwara! A
lady met me a few days back. She spoke about an incident that
went against her inclinations. Her daughter saw her gesturing, and
asked what she was doing. ‘I am beating the Ishwara’, she replied.
‘I am blaming Him for not doing what I wanted.’ What had
296

---

## Page 297

happened was indeed bad. It was set right later on. Maybe the
Ishwara did feel the lady’s punches! Everything turned out all
right with His Grace. What I want to point out is that when a
person gets angry, he wants to hit out even at the Ishwara!
So, you see, one is the urge that what you think is the right thing.
This urge is absolutely wrong. You know nothing about your past
or future lives. You have no idea about what is in your
antaraatmaa (the Atma in you). And yet you are convinced that
what you think is right. It is this desire that creates anger –
kaamaatkrodobhijaayate`.
If you fear that you will get angry, make up your mind to remain
silent. Start chanting Bhagwan’s name. Have a glass of sherbet.
Once, the cooks at our Ashram went on strike. There were five or
six cooks at that time. Now, what would the Sadhus eat? Just then,
one of our Mahatmas from Vrindavan came to the Ashram. When
he heard about the strike, he said, ‘The first thing you should do is
to give thandai (a flavored milk drink) to all the cooks. They sit
before the fire for long hours. The heat has gone to their head.
That is why they have become irritable.’
This is one reason why women become irritable. They take the
trouble to prepare the meal, and you sit back comfortably and
make critical comments about the food. Try to do the cooking one
day! It is easy to find fault and criticize!
So, when you start feeling irritable, drink a glass or two of water,
and chant the name of Bhagwan. A Seth (wealthy businessman)
told me, ‘Maharaj, I cannot control my temper.’
‘Impose a penalty on yourself,’ I suggested. ‘Give ten rupees to
your servant every time you get angry.’ This worked very well for
a few days, but then his servants understood that they would get
ten rupees if they made him angry! This was here, in Mumbai. I
have been coming here for over thirty five years now. I first came
in 1935 or 1936. In those days I would stay at Singhania House.
On one of my visits, I was kept hidden for nearly a fortnight. Then
Maganlal Joshi heard that I was here and took me away with him.
297

---

## Page 298

Impose a penalty, but don’t do anything drastic like giving up
food. Don’t stop eating. A short-tempered person should never
give up food altogether. He should give up some sweet he likes.
Keep a small bottle of honey in your purse or pocket, and place a
couple of drops of honey on your tongue when you begin to get
angry. Let the penalty of losing your temper be that you will give
up milk and tea for a week. You enjoy salt and sugar in your food
– try the fun of a weeks’ salt free or sugar free diet! This will
effectively reduce your anger. The thought of missing sugar will
come as soon as you feel anger rising, and your anger will
subside.
Or, if you have a large mirror at home, go and see your face in it
when you are in a rage. See how your eyes redden and your mouth
is twisted in an ugly manner. If you lose your temper every day,
your face will turn black. The flush of anger results in your face
becoming black. No beauty parlor will be able to remove this
darkness. So, you should control your temper even for the sake of
your good looks.
Then, you should do a praayashchit (atonement; penance) to
either walk a certain distance or do a certain number of maalaa
(rosary). And yes! There is one word of warning about looking
into the mirror. The thing is, you can go and examine your face in
the mirror when you get angry, but if your husband or mother-in-
law are angry, don’t suggest to them that they go and see
themselves in the mirror! They may pick up the mirror and hit you
with it!
I will tell you more about how to deal with anger, lust, greed, and
delusion. If you are sincere about overcoming greed, I can tell you
of an unfailing method. I know that you will find this a bitter
medicine to swallow, but if you develop the Daivi sampada and
then interact in the world, not only will you be happy, you will
also make others happy.

Pravachan XXIII
Cultivate Daivi Sampada – 6
(Shanti, Apaishunam, and Achapalata)
The Dharma of a manushya (human being) is manushyatva
(having the qualities of a human being). That means a human
being should not do anything that lowers him to the level of an
animal. Krodha (anger), hinsaa (violence), lobha (greed), dve`sha
(hatred), etc are all relics of an animal existence. They are retained
as sanskaara (subtle subconscious impressions) left over from
past lives, when the jeevaatmaa (the Atma attached to a body)
was in the form of an animal. These sanskaras rise up occasionally
in the life of a human being, but they cannot be sustained.
Give a little thought to this – can anyone stay angry for twenty
four hours at a stretch? Let us forget the time he spends sleeping;
can he stay angry for eighteen hours? This is just not possible.
Now, can anyone keep telling lies all twenty four hours? If he lies
down and says that he is walking – and the reverse – it will be a
lie. However, if he keeps saying this, people will understand what
he means and his lie will become the truth. That means, the
dosha-durguna (faults and bad tendencies) are not natural for us.
The meaning of manushyatva is that we can stay without telling a
lie for twenty four hours, but we can’t go on telling lies
continuously. We can refrain from getting angry for twenty four
hours, but we cannot hold on to anger throughout the day. We can
be free of lust, but we can’t experience lust for twenty four hours.
That makes it clear that kaama (lust), krodha, lobha, jhootha (lies)
etc, are not a part of our life. They have come from outside, and
they will go away.
Now, think about what is easy to give up. It is easy to give up
kama, but it is not easy to give up brahmacharya (celibacy). It is
299

---

## Page 300

easy to give up krodha, but it is not easy to give up akrodha (lack
of anger). It is difficult to give up ahinsaa (non-violence), because
you cannot be violent continuously all day long. Satya
(truthfulness) can be maintained all day long, but asatya (telling
lies) cannot. So, you should pay attention to this aspect of your
life, and be vigilant. People justify getting angry by saying that
their position compels them. Some people say, ‘My brother, I am
a grown up man. I have the right to use foul language.’ They don’t
know that nobody has the right to use foul language – not even the
Paramatma!
Let us take another look at the Daivi sampada. To not lose your
temper, to maintain non-violence, to forgive, and to not revolt –
see how many things the Daivi sampada contains. However, I
want to make one thing clear first. Daivi sampada is not meant for
everybody. To have a human form and behave like a human is for
all people, but to be a jigyaasu (seeker of the ultimate truth) or
Gnani is for some people, not for all.
I can tell the jigyasus who seek Gnan about some of the points
that are not present in those who seek the Daivi sampada. For
example, aachaaryopaasana – worship of the Guru. A person
who wants Gnan should serve his Guru and stay with him, but this
is not needed for a person who wants to obtain the Daivi sampada.
Therefore, staying with the Guru is not essential for obtaining the
Daivi sampada, but it is necessary for tapasyaa (asceticism). A
person who wants to do tapasya should worship his Guru, and a
person who wants Gnan should worship his Acharya (Master).
That means, if you are spending your life engrossed in worldly
considerations, with no desire to obtain the Ishwara, Gnan, or
Samadhi, then worshipping your Guru is not essential for you.
If you have had the yagyopaveeta sanskaara (the ritual of
receiving the sacred thread and the Gayatri mantra), and if your
Acharya has initiated you to a mantra, if you are inclined to
worship a Devta and have received a mantra to worship Bhagwan
Vishnu or Shankar, that is something achieved. However,
Acharya upasana is needed when you have a desire to obtain the
300

---

## Page 301

Ishwara, or Gnan (enlightenment). This is specific; it is not
common to all; whereas having universal goodwill is advisable for
all. Live like a sajjan (ethical, upright human being).
I will tell you more. If you want to obtain Gnan,
Indriyaarthe`shu vairaagyamanahankaara e`va cha,
janmamrityujaraavyaadhi dukhadoshaanudarshanam.
(13. 8)
(Freedom from all attachments for the sensual delights of this
world or other realms, an absence of ego, thinking repeatedly
about the suffering and flaws of birth, old age and disease.)
This ‘janmamrityujaraavyaadhidukhadoshaanudarshanam’ is
essential if you want to obtain Gnan, but it is not essential for
obtaining the Daivi sampada. A good human being does not need
to focus on the thought, ‘I am trapped in the cycle of birth and
death. I will grow old and have diseases.’ An ordinary human
being doesn’t need to focus on these things and give up his work
or business, but it is essential for a person who wants to develop
vairaagya (detachment) for the world, and obtain Tattvagnan
(knowledge of the essence of the Brahman).
Janmamriyuujaraavyaadhidukhadoshaanudarshanam.
Daivi sampada is necessary for a sajjan. Vairagya is necessary for
a person who wants to obtain Gnan. We have arrangements for
both.
Asaktiranabhishvanga putradaaraagrihaadishu,
nityam cha samachittatvamishtaanishtopapattishu.
(13. 9)
(Absence of attachment for the son, wife, home, and wealth, lack
of possessiveness, and mental equanimity in favorable and
unfavorable circumstances.)
This does not come within the Daivi sampatti either.
301

---

## Page 302

Adhyaatmagnaananityatvam tattvagnaanaarthadarshanam.
(13. 11)
(To be established in metaphysical knowledge is Gnan.
Tattvagnan is to see that everything is the Paramatma.)
This doesn’t come in the Daivi sampatti either.
My reason for clarifying this is that people have become confused
about these points. Where there is a need for someone to just be a
good human being with Daivi sampatti, people try to make him a
Sadhu; and if someone’s antahkaran (fourfold mind) is pure and
he has an urge to know the ultimate truth, he is discouraged from
becoming a Sadhu. So, Narayana! The meaning of the Daivi
sampada is to inculcate a universal benevolence and uprightness
into your life.
Yesterday I had spoken about krodha, hinsa and dvesha. You will
see that a bhakta’s characteristics are different from those of a
man who has the Daivi sampada. The nishthaa (conviction)
needed for obtaining Gnan is of a different kind.
Gandhiji was once traveling from Gorakhpur to Benaras. He was
sitting in a third class compartment, reading a newspaper. One
man got in – you can call him a gentleman or an uncultured man
or whatever you want! Yudhishthira used to call Duryodhan
‘Suyodhan’ (dur indicates ‘bad’ and su indicates ‘good’). Have
you heard this, or not? A Mahatma I know, Sant Sai, would not
utter the word ‘kurasi’ (chair); he said ‘surasi’ instead. Somebody
asked him, ‘Sai, why do you say surasi instead of kurasi?’
‘My brother, I feel hesitant to say ku’, he said (‘ku’ also indicates
‘bad’). He had had a bitter experience about the use of words. A
man was doing something, and he had called out, ‘Hey, paagal
(madman), what are you doing?’ As soon as he said ‘pagal’, the
man went mad. His sanity was restored after a great deal of
trouble. Ever since then, Sai had said that no bad words should be
used.
In our village, people say, ‘Punditaayin, shubha bolo – O wife of
a Pundit, say things that are auspicious.’ Never say anything
302

---

## Page 303

inauspicious about anyone, because everything that is said spreads
in space and comes back to us. It has an effect on our mind. What
we say for others will be done for us.
Now, the man who came into Gandhiji’s compartment spat on the
floor. People chew beetle nut leaves, and tobacco, and spit out the
juice. This man spat on the floor of the compartment and sat
down. Gandhiji tore off a bit of the newspaper he was reading and
wiped it up. He threw the paper away and resumed reading his
newspaper. The man was intrigued. After a while he spat again,
and Gandhiji again cleaned up the spittle. This happened four or
five times, and each time Gandhiji cleaned the spittle without
saying a word.
When the train reached Benaras, thousands of people had come to
receive Gandhiji. The air was filled with shouts of ‘Mahatma
Gandhi ki jai! Bharat mata ki jai!’
‘The man who wiped my spittle is Mahatma Gandhi!!’ The man
felt a deep shame. He fell at Gandhiji’s feet. ‘Please punish me,’
he begged. See Gandhiji’s forgiving nature. See his benevolence
and Daivi sampatti. ‘I will not punish you,’ he said, ‘but in future
if you see anyone spitting as you did, clean it up as I did.’ It is the
Dharma of a human being to keep clean the place he stays at, the
atmosphere, his body, clothes and mind.
I am not giving you any profound lecture on Gnan. This is an
absolutely basic Dharma. If someone cannot follow even the basic
Dharma, talk about Gnan is wasted on him. Someone who
tolerates dirt on his body, clothes and mind will also tolerate
Maya (the Ishwara’s power of delusion) in the Brahman. It is only
when you refuse to accept dirt in yourself that you will reject
Maya in the Brahman. Look at yourself first!
A Raja got annoyed with a Brahmin. ‘So what if you are my
purohita (family priest)?’ he said. ‘Don’t enter the palace in
future.’ The Brahmin was very upset. A Shudra (low caste
untouchable) saw his agitation and was moved to pity. He decided
to help the Brahmin. He went close to the palace walls and began
to shout for his brother.
303

---

## Page 304

‘What is the matter?’ asked Raja sahib.
‘My brother is hiding in your palace,’ said the sweeper.
‘My good man, why should your brother come into the palace?’
Then it dawned on Raja Sahib that the sweeper was giving him a
hint. ‘This low caste Chandala is referring to my anger. He is
indicating that anger is a Chandala. He calls anger his brother.’
A Mahatma had told me a story. A Harijan (untouchable) woman
used to bathe in the Jamunaji at Vrindavan. She would bring her
Thakurji (Bhagwan’s idol) in a basket, and do her daily worship
after her bath. The local Brahmins and their wives resented the
thought of a low caste woman bathing where they bathed, so they
complained about her to the Raja Sahib. He ordered his man to
find and bring the woman, in whatever condition they found her.
It so happened that the Harijan woman had just finished her bath
and her worship when the soldiers came and told her that she was
to go with them to Raja Sahib. On the way, they passed the hut of
a Brahmin. The Brahmin’s wife – who used to insult the Harijan
woman every day – had just come out of her hut, to throw out her
child’s night soil. The soldiers caught her also and made her go
with them as she was.
When they reached the Raja, he saw one freshly bathed woman
carrying her Thakurji in a basket and one dirty woman carrying
night soil. He bowed to the Thakurji the Harijan woman was
carrying, and told the Brahmin woman that she was not to bathe in
the Jamunaji in future. The Brahmins pleaded desperately!
Thus, this krodha, hinsa, and droha (rebellion) don’t allow us to
remain good. Please keep this in mind. Anger, violence, and lust
cannot remain with us all the time, but truth, non-violence, etc can
always remain with us. It is possible to remain nishkaama (free of
desire) and akrodha (free of anger). We can always be honest, but
stealing comes like a visitor and leaves. There is no need to give
dishonesty a place in your life.
What has gone wrong is that the Daivi sampada that was meant
for our daily life has got attached to Ishwara bhakti. Whether you
want the Ishwara or not, does not concern me. A naastika (one
304

---

## Page 305

who does not believe in Bhagwan) can also be a Hindu, and an
aastika (one who believes in Bhagwan) can also be a Hindu.
People who say that only an astika can be a Hindu know nothing
about Hinduism. The Katha Upanishad says that one kind of
people say that the Atma remains after death, and another kind
says that it doesn’t. Both these opinions of the Upanishads have
been given right from the beginning. ‘Indro naasti anye`
manyante`’ –
There is a mantra in the Rig Veda that Indra does not exist. This is
not a dispute between the astika and the nastika. A human being
should have the qualities of a sajjan regardless, shouldn’t he? You
read:
Abhayam sattvasanshuddhih gnaanayogavyavasthitih,
daanam damashcha yagyashcha svaadhyaayastapa aarjavam.
(16. 1)
(A complete absence of fear, an antahkaran that is pure, being
established continuously in meditation to obtain Tattvagnan,
doing sattvik charity, subduing the senses, worshipping Bhagwan,
the Devtas, and people worthy of veneration, doing good rituals
like Yagyas, reading the Vedas and Shatras, singing Bhagwan’s
praises and chanting His names, enduring discomfort in the course
of doing your duty, and being simple and straightforward.)
These characteristics are not those of a bhakta. A bhakta’s
characteristics are described as ‘Yo madbhaktah sa me` priyah –
My bhakta is dear to Me.’
Shraddhaavaan bhajate` yo maam sa me` yuktatamo matah.
(6. 46)
(The Yogi who worships Me constantly with shraddha is, in My
opinion, the most superior Yogi.)
It is a different thing to do bhakti and a different thing to remain a
sajjan. It is a different thing to be a Gnani and a different thing to
305

---

## Page 306

be a sajjan. To be a Gnani, it is necessary to worship the Master,
be detached from worldly considerations, be free of attachments,
and have faith in the non-dual Atma. To be a sajjan, however, the
abhe`da bhakti (belief in the non-dual Atma) is not needed.

This is essential for a Gnani, but not essential for a sajjan.
‘Maanaapamaanayostulyastulyomitraaripakshayoh’ (retaining

for a gunaateeta (one who is beyond the influences of the three
tendencies that effect people’s actions). It is one thing to be a
Gnani and another thing to be a bhakta., and yet another thing to
practice what you need to, to obtain brahmanishthaa (faith in the
Brahman).

(A person whose intellect is pure, whose food is light, sattvik and
regular, who has given up sensual indulgences, lives alone in a
pure place, restrains his senses, mind, speech and body, destroys
attachments and hatred, is unconcerned with worldly matters, has

accumulation, meditates constantly, and is mentally tranquil is
eligible to merge into the Sacchidananda Brahman.

always in a state of bliss. He does not grieve for anyone, nor does

he want anything. He has equal benevolence for all human beings.
Such a Yogi obtains My supreme bhakti.)
If you want to go on the path of Gnan, your intellect must first be
purified. Does your intellect advise you to take things from others
through treachery and deviousness? If this is what your intellect is
like, how will you progress on the path of Gnan? If you have no
pre`ma (pure love) for the Brahman, where will the pure Brahman
come from?
I am telling you a secret. You can make a note of it if you want.
The world you see, the prapancha, is called avidyaa (lack of the
right knowledge; nescience) if you attach it to yourself; and it is
called maayaa (the Ishwara’s power of delusion) if you attach it to
the Ishwara. It is Maya because you continue to see the world, but
don’t see the Ishwara behind it. When you obtain the Gnan that
the Atma and the Ishwara are one, neither does the avidya remain
nor does Maya remain, since the prapanch does not remain either.
When the prapanch is connected to us, so is avidya. When it is
connected to the Ishwara, we are connected to Maya. ‘The
Ishwara has made this prapanch. This Ishwara has become this
prapanch. The Ishwara exists in the form of this prapanch and He
destroys it through Dissolution.’ If you connect the prapanch to
the Ishwara, it does not cause delusion in Him. It neither ensnares
nor affects Him in any way, because He is not affected by His
Maya. The prapanch connected to the Ishwara is Maya, and the
prapanch connected to us ensnares us. It encompasses us and
binds us, and that is why it is called avidya.
When you have the experience that the Atma and the Paramatma
are one, the prapanch is seen to be mithyaa (a relative truth), and
when the prapanch is known to be mithya, there is no Maya in the
Ishwara and no avidya either. This is the secret.
What I mean to say is that sadguna (good tendencies) should be
incorporated into our lives. If you do not attach much importance
to the Ishwara, I am not urging you to do so. If you don’t believe
in other realms after death, that is all right with me. I do not say
307

---

## Page 308

that you must believe in the Ishwara. If you don’t want to go into
a Samadhi, don’t. However, the Daivi sampada should come into
your life. You should know how your life is being spent.
Abhayam sattvasanshuddhih gnaanayogavyavasthitih,
daanam damashcha yagyashcha svaadhyaayastapa aarjavam.
Ahinsaa satyamakrodastyaagah shaantirapaishunam,
dayaa bhoote`shvaloluptvam maardavam hreerachaapalam.
Te`jah kshamaa dhriti shauchamadroho naatimaanitaa,
(16. 1,2,3)
(Absolute freedom from fear, purity of mind, meditating
constantly on Tattvagnan, doing the right kind of charity,
restraining the senses, worshipping Bhagwan, the Devtas and
venerable people, doing good rituals like Yagyas, studying the
Vedas and Shastras, singing Bhagwan’s praises and names, and
enduring hardships in the course of doing your duty.
Not causing pain to any by thought, word or deed, speaking the
truth with sweetness, not getting angry with even those who harm
you, being free of the subtle ego of being the doer, remaining
unattached and tranquil, being compassionate towards all, not
getting attached to sense objects even when you indulge, being
ashamed to do anything that is against the Shastras or society, and
giving up all unnecessary activities.
To have a brightness of spirit, be forgiving, have forbearance and
external purity, no enmity for any, and no wish to be given
respect.)
If there is a feeling of paishun in your life, meaning, if you have
an inclination for malicious gossip, it is not the Dharma of a
sajjan. A sajjan does not go around pointing out the faults in
people and spreading rumors. It does not behove a sajjan to
indulge in chapalataa (restlessness, frivolity and flirtatiousness).
Many people have a habit of shaking their legs, hands, or mouth.
This is chapalataa (restlessness). You should have sthirataa
(steadfastness; stability) in your life. In the description of the
308

---

## Page 309

Daivi sampatti, it is said that you should not indulge in malicious
gossip, and you should not have mental or physical restlessness.
You should adopt the characteristics of a sajjan.
People think that the message of the Gita is that everybody should
become a Sadhu, but that is not the case. The Gita tells you to be a
good, upright human being. I will tell you some more
characteristics of the Daivi sampada.
Te`jah – this te`ja (a sharp, fiery intellect) is not included in the
characteristics of Gnan. A human being should be te`jasvee
(radiant; noble spirited). A human being should have a fiery
personality so that he is not dominated by others, else, he will be
made to bleat like a goat and bullied into wrongdoing. A human
being’s spirit should be such that no wrong urge can overcome
him, nor can anyone else intimidate him into doing what he knows
is wrong. This is different from a bhakta, Gnani, and gunaateeta
(one who is beyond the influence of the three tendencies that rule
people’s actions).
You can lead a life filled with the Daivi sampada even if you
don’t believe in past or future births. The Charvaks do not believe
in past or future lives. The Christians and Muslims do not accept
past lives, but they accept life after death. The Buddhists and Jains
accept past and future lives. You people keep hearing about
rebirth. The Vedantis say that even this birth is not real; leave
alone past and future births! You believe that you have been born,
but that is a false impression. This is not a birth; it is a state of
being.
While you are in the state of your present body, please do not get
ensnared in the mistaken belief that I wish to prove the paraloka
(realms after death) or even this loka (this world), or birth. If you
are trapped by this mistaken understanding, you will become
absolutely prejudiced. Let those who want to be prejudiced or
stubborn believe what they want. Let the Pundits prove their
opinions, and the Maulvis prove theirs. Whatever the principle of
your life may be, let it be filled with good qualities. Let it not
309

---

## Page 310

create sorrow for you or other. If you live in a way that causes
sorrow for others, sorrow is bound to come into your life.
Sorrow comes because you form the habit of holding on to it.
Your face gets twisted when you see someone. Your eyes get
clouded by some sight, or you begin to frown. What is it that
spoils your heart and intellect? What effort are you making to
keep yourself free of external influences? Manufacturers of
watches make watches that are waterproof and shockproof.
Garment manufacturers make stain-resistant clothes. What effort
do you make to protect your mind from being sullied? Please
listen to what I say in warning. If you have prema for someone in
this world, and he dies, you will experience great sorrow.
Vyavahaara (worldly interaction) is a different thing and it is
another thing to have prema for worldly objects. Your interaction
should be loving. You should speak lovingly, look at people
affectionately, and greet them warmly. The prema in vyavhara is a
different thing, but if you bind yourself emotionally to someone,
death is sure to separate you and cause suffering. I am not telling
you anything worldly. The Atma is ageless and eternal. It never
dies. Nobody can experience death.
What will happen if you are strongly attached to your body? You
will feel distress when your body begins to die. You will live on
and your body will die. Sorrow is certain if you love anything that
is subject to destruction. When your body dies, all the things that
are connected to it will be left behind. It is written in our Shastras
that just as we fall asleep and wake up every day, death comes
millions of times in the infinite life of a jeevaatmaa (the Atma
attached to a body). This is told to us to remove our dread of
death. We go to sleep and don a new body when we awaken. That
is all death is. That, too, is only for those who do not have Gnan.
If you believe that death is like going to sleep, you will not suffer
so much, but if you think that you will lose all you have when you
die, you will suffer much more. Death is far more painful for a
person who has strong worldly attachments, than for someone
who is aware that he will, one day, have to part from his loved
310

---

## Page 311

people and possessions. People even grieve at the thought of
giving up their position of power. It is a fact that you will have to
leave this world one day. If you get attached to anything of this
world it is bound to give you pain the day you have to give it up.
You are voluntarily creating the means of your own suffering.
Very well; I will tell you one final point. There are different
methods and remedies for removing the different dosha (faults),
but there is one sure-shot remedy, called the ‘Rama-baan’ that
cures a number of ailments. There are many medicines, and new
ones are being introduced every day, making the old ones
redundant. When I was young, there was a popular medicine
called ‘Amritdhara’. I don’t think it is available any more. It is not
my intention to advertise this medicine, but it was used for a large
variety of problems, from fever to headache to stomach ache. It
could be imbued or applied locally, or used as nasal drops. It was
effective for a hundred problems. In those days, the modern range
of medicines had not been developed. There were some medicines
that were used for many health problems.
The Shastras say that satya (truthfulness) is the medicine for
asatya (falsehood), aste`ya (not coveting what belongs to another)
is the remedy for the urge to steal, brahmacharya (celibacy) is the
cure for lust, and aparigraha (lack of accumulation) is the
medicine for greed. These are different medicines for different
ailments. If you are a habitual liar, start speaking only the truth.
I will tell you one Rama-baan remedy to cure all ailments. The
fact is that the durgunas (bad tendencies) are many, but the
sadguna (good tendency) is one. This sadguna takes on different
forms, and destroys many faults. There is only one sadguna. It
comes as satya and destroys asatya. It comes as asteya and
destroys dishonesty. It comes as ahinsaa (non-violence) and
destroys anger. And, it comes as aparigraha and destroys greed.
The guna (tendency) is one, but it takes on the different garbs and
destroys different faults.
What is that sadguna? What exists when there is no desire for
anything that belongs to another? It is shaanti (inner peace). What
311

---

## Page 312

exists when there is no violence or desire to cheat, or steal? What
is present when lust is absent, and when there is no excessive
accumulation? It is shanti. The fact is that inner tranquility is the
biggest sadguna.
If you wish to increase the sadguna in your life, just accept this
prescription I am offering you. Don’t assume that I am hiding
anything or that I have some hidden agenda. You will not have to
spend anything or conceal anything. What you have to do is to be
careful that nothing should be allowed to disturb your inner peace.
Whether you interact with others, do sadhana, are at home or
outside, whether you meet your friend or foe, your tranquility
should be maintained.
If your mind is at peace, you will not be overcome by lust or
anger. You will not succumb to a desire to steal or cheat, nor
indulge in excessive accumulation. Nor will you be inclined to tell
lies. Just make sure that your mind remains tranquil. All the other
names are different garbs of shanti. No matter what the situation,
be at peace. Whether it is day or night, birth or death, profit or
loss, whether a Kingdom is won or lost, the greatest good is that
your inner peace remains intact. A human being is not created to
become agitated over paltry matters.
Na manushyaat shre`shthataram kinchit.
Nothing is superior to a human being. Nothing is greater or more
beautiful. All the good tendencies are available to a human. A
human can have all the excellent tendencies and inclinations. You
weaken yourself morally when you lie, cheat, or harm someone to
get something. You lower yourself when you think that you
cannot be happy unless your lust is fulfilled. To believe that good
things can be obtained only by lowering your principles is the root
of all wrong tendencies. You surrender yourself to the wrong
tendencies.
When you succumb to wrong tendencies you are saying that
worldly objects are more important than you are; that you are
312

---

## Page 313

willing to make yourself small, in order to obtain them. You are
saying that the worldly objects are so important to you that you
are willing to harm, lie, steal, and give up Dharma and morality
for them. Thus, when you demean yourself for worldly
considerations, your shanti is shattered; and when your shanti is
shattered, the durgunas creep in.
Thus, the Gita does not speak only about ritual worship. In fact,
apart from ‘Yagyaanaam japayagyosmi – among Yagyas I am
japa’, there is no mention of ritual chanting in the Gita. In case
you see it, please show it to me! Nor does the Gita say anything
about applying chandan (sandalwood paste). You will, however,
find repeated mention abut being a good human being. In fact,
even Gnan has been put aside. The Gita tells you what to do if you
want to be a Gnani, or a bhakta, or a gunateeta. It tells you how
Tattvagnan is obtained. But, if you don’t particularly want any of
these, you should certainly be a sajjan. And, to be a sajjan, it is
essential to have the Daivi sampatti in your life.
More tomorrow.

Pravachan XXIV
The Gita’s Advice is for All
The Gita is the speech of Bhagwan. Just as a father says what
benefits all his children, the Gita’s advice benefits everybody,
regardless of gender, sect, region, country or species. Whatever
befits all is what Bhagwan says. The words that benefit some, but
not all, are not Bhagwan’s words, because He says only that,
which is good for all.
There are many political parties. Some are for the benefit of the
poor and some are for the benefit of the rich. Some favor one
country and some favor another. Bhagwan’s benevolence,
however, is not limited to any caste, creed, gender, or country.
Millions of universes have been created and destroyed. More will
be created and destroyed in future, and many exist at present.
They all pulsate in Bhagwan’s essence. Just as fire has sparks,
Bhagwan’s essence has unimaginable powers. His Maha Maya
(great power of delusion) – His Yoga Shakti – keeps creating
millions of universes. In fact, she is all that exists. Bhagwan’s
wish to bestow good fortune is not restricted to the wise; He also
wants to bestow good fortune to those who have shraddhaa
(faith).
The sixteenth chapter of the Gita describes the Daivi sampada (the
wealth of divine qualities). Daivi sampada – or Daivi sampatti –
means superior qualities. If excellent qualities come into your life,
you progress on the path to Moksha (liberation from rebirth).
Bhagwan says –
Daivee sampadvimokshaaya nibandhaayaasuree mataa.
(16. 5)
(The Daivi sampada is believed to lead to liberation, and the Asuri
– Demonic – sampada to bondage.)
314

---

## Page 315

If good qualities come into your life, you will attain mukti
(liberation from rebirth), and if you adopt durguna (bad
tendencies) the aasuree sampatti (demonic tendencies) you will
be trapped into bondage. When Sattva guna (the lofty tendency)
rises, a person gets the Daivi sampada, and when Tamo guna (the
lowly tendency) rises, a person gets the Asuri sampada. When
both are mixed in a person, he has the Rajo guna (mixed
tendencies) sampada.
Dambho darpobhimaanashcha krodhah paarushyame`va cha,
Agnaanam chaabhijaatasya paartha sampadamaasureem.
(16. 4)
(O Partha, know that hypocrisy, arrogance, vanity, anger, harsh
speech and ignorance are Asuri qualities.)
To do dambha is to be a hypocrite. To do darpa is to have a
superiority complex. Anger, harsh speech, callousness, and rough
behavior are all characteristics of the Asuri sampada. Such people
always taunt others and speak sarcastically. They show no
gentleness or goodwill. People who are learned in Sanskrit
literature say that no matter what you talk about, the description
should not be arid or lacking in sweetness.
There is a folk tale that two Pundits went to a Raja. He told them
to describe a dead tree standing close by. ‘Shushko vriksha
tishthati agre` - a dried up tree stands there,’ said one Pundit. The
other Pundit said, ‘Neerasataruh vilasati puratah – the tree
standing there has no juice in it.’ Both described the same object,
but the second Pundit’s words were gentle. To describe something
in a harsh manner is also a characteristic of the Asuri sampada.
Therefore, Bhagwan also teaches us how to speak in a cultured
manner.
I was telling you that in the sixteenth chapter of the Gita,
Bhagwan is telling us to improve ourselves by cultivating superior
qualities. This is in no way connected to obtaining Bhagwan. In
315

---

## Page 316

the seventeenth chapter He tells us to uplift ourselves by
developing shraddha.
Yo yachchraddhah sa e`va sah.
(17. 3)
(A person is what his shraddha is.)
You will remember that the seventeenth chapter describes the
habits of people with Sattva, Rajo and Tamo gunas. It describes
their food preferences, Yoga, and tapa (asceticism), daan
(charity) and karma (actions). If you want to do anything,
Om tatsaditi nirde`sho brahmanastrividhah smritah.
(17. 23)
(Tad-sat. Take the name of Bhagwan before starting any work.)
Tatsadomityudaahritya yagyadaanatapah kriyaah,
pravartante` vidhaanoktaah satatam brahmavaadinam.
(17. 24)
(This is why superior people, who follow the rules of the Shastras
when they do any Yagya, daan or tapa, say ‘Aum’ before
starting.)
Say the name of Bhagwan before doing anything. See one point –
if a person does something with faith in the Shastras, Bhagwan
Shri Krishna tells us that we should work with full faith in the
Shastras.
Why?
Because nobody can obtain happiness and peace if they flout the
Shastras. You would surely have read this in the Gita.
Yah shaastravidhimutsrijya vartate` kaamakaaratah,
na sa siddhimavaapnoti na sukham na paraam gatim.
Tasmaadchchastram pramaanam te` kaaryaakaaryavyapasthitau,
gnaatvaa shaastravidhaanoktam karmakartumihaarhasi.
316

---

## Page 317

(16. 23, 24)
(A person who disdains the Shastras and does things whimsically
gets neither success, nor salvation, nor happiness.
That is why only the Shastras can establish what your duty is, and
what is not your duty. Know this, and do whatever the Shastras
say you are eligible for.)
If you want to do something, don’t do it whimsically. Learn the
correct method as described in the Shastras. People tend to think
that they have been born knowing everything, but they should
learn the correct method regardless. They may have learnt
everything when they were in the womb, but that was a long time
ago, and they may have forgotten something by now!
Tasmaachchastram pramaanam te` karyakaaryavyavasthitau. A
lady may have a Master’s degree in cookery, but she should see
how a dish is cooked before she tries to cook it. Similarly, a
Pundit may have learnt the science of doing a Yagya, but his
theoretical knowledge will not be of much use until he has seen
how his seniors do the ritual. What I mean to say is that academic
learning is not always enough; practical knowledge and
experience are also required.
Very well; on one side Bhagwan says that the Shastras establish
what kaarya (right action) and akaarya (wrong or futile action)
are; on the other hand He also says –
Jigyaasurapi yogasya shabdabrahmaativartate`.
(6. 44)
(A person who seeks to obtain Bhagwan by remaining poised in
Yoga also rises above the fruits of the rituals that give worldly
benefits.)
Aren’t these contradictory statements? Where external actions are
concerned, you should follow the rules of the Shastras. When you
wish to go inwards, it becomes a wish to know about Yoga; about
uniting with your Atma. You have to let go of everything that
317

---

## Page 318

appears to be the idam – this, which is separate from ‘I’. Catch
hold of that, which remains when everything else is negated. In
this state, you rise above the shabda brahma (the verbal
descriptions of the Brahman). No instructions can be given here.
There are no common rules in this state.
The Gita says one more thing –
Niyatam kuru karma tvam karmajyaayo hyakarmanah.
(3. 8)
(Continue to do what the Shastras tell you to do, because it is
better to work than to be idle.)
You should definitely go on doing your work. It is better to work
than to be idle. That means, Bhagwan has given a strong
indication on the importance of work. On the other hand, ‘Tasya
kaarya na vidyate`’ (3. 17) – a person reaches a state where he has
no further duties.
So, the Gita is meant for the shraddhaalu (people with faith), the
sadgunee (people with good tendencies), the kartavya paraayana
(those who believe in doing their duty) and the Yogis. This means
that Bhagwan’s speech is for the benefit of all. The Gita’s
message is for people who have faith and for those who want to
connect their intellect to the Ishwara. If you wish to be free of
paapa-punya (sin and spiritual merit) let me tell you the method –
Buddhiyukto jahaateeha ubhe` sukritadushkrite`.
(2. 50)
(An equipoised person rises above both punya and paapa in this
very life. Meaning, he attains liberation.)
The Gita helps you to free yourself from paapa-punya. If you want
to be free of moha (delusion),
Yatgnaatvaa na punarmoham e`vam gnaasyasi paandava.
(4. 35)
318

## Page 319

(O Arjuna, once you obtain this Gnan you will no longer be
deluded.)
The Gita is Bhagavati (the Goddess). Bhagwan’s speech has an
eagerness to uplift the lowest of the downfallen. In many of our
Mandirs there is a notice that forbids the entry of people who
don’t believe in the Arya Dharma. Now, see the rule of
Bhagwan’s realm:
Maam hi paartha vyapaashritya ye`pi syuh paapayonayah,
streeyo vaishyaastathaa shoodraaste`pi yaanti paraam gatim.
Kim punarbraahmanaah punyaa bhaktaa raajarshayastathaa,
anityamasukham lokamimam praapya bhajasva maam.
(9. 32, 33)
(O Arjuna, a woman, trader, laborer, or untouchable – no matter
who it may be, obtains salvation when he takes refuge in Me.
So, what doubt can there be that a pious Brahmin or a Raja who is
a Sage and a bhakta, will obtain salvation when he takes refuge in
Me? You should worship Me lovingly and continuously while you
are in this human form that is temporary and contains no
happiness.)
Bhagwan says –
Api che`tsuduraachaaro bhajate` maamananyabhaak.
(9. 30)
(Even a very bad man should be considered a Sadhu if he
worships Me continuously with love, because he has made the
right resolve, that worshipping Bhagwan is the best thing to do in
life.)
If there is a wicked man in our country or community, if there is
anyone in Bhagwan’s Kingdom who has bad tendencies – will the
doors to Mukti be closed to him? Won’t any door be open for a
durachari? No; that is not the case. The door to liberation will be
open also for him. Bhagwan will find some method, some way, by
which even the worst sinner can go to Him.
319

---

## Page 320

Api che`tsuduraachaaro bhajate` maamananyabhaak – if even a
durachari worships Bhagwan with single-minded devotion,
Bhagwan tells us, ‘I am commanding you –
Saadhure`va sa mantavyah samyagvyavasito hi sah.’
(9. 30)
(Consider him to be a Sadhu, because he has made the right
resolve, that devoted worship of the Paramatma is the best thing to
do in life.)
Bhagwan says, ‘It is not that I consider him to be a Sadhu. You
should consider him to be a Sadhu.’ This is the duty of society,
the duty of every human being, the duty of every being in the
millions of universes.
Why?
Because, samyagvyavasthito hi sah – his resolve is very elevated.
He aspires to be a Sadhu. It is another thing whether he succeeds
or not, but his intention is pure, his goal is pure, and the purity of
his goal makes him a superior person.
Kshipram bhavati dharmaatmaa shashvachhaantim nigachhati.
(9. 31)
(He quickly becomes a pious person and obtains everlasting
peace.)
Hanumanprasadji would snap his fingers when he said ‘kshipram’
(quickly), whenever he spoke on this shloka, to indicate how
quickly a paapee (sinner) becomes a Dharmatma (pious person),
and obtains everlasting peace. Which means, he not only obtains
the saadhan (method of spiritual progress), he also obtains the
fruit of the sadhana, which is everlasting peace.
Shashvachhaantim nigachhati. He obtains an inner tranquility that
nothing can disturb.
Bhagwan said, ‘Someone may have doubts that since he is a
paapi, he will be destroyed; but I say that he will become a
320

---

## Page 321

Dharmatma and obtain peace.’ A paapi should be destroyed. You
read in the Gita –
Dhyaayato vishayaanpunsah sangaste`shoopajaayate`,
sangaatsanjaayate` kaamah kaamaatkrodhobhijaayate`.
Krodhaatbhavati sammohah sammohaatsmritivibhramah,
smritibhranshhadbuddhinaasho buddhinaashaatpranashyati.
(2. 62, 63)
(A person who thinks about worldly objects gets attached to them.
He develops a strong desire to obtain them and gets angry when
he can’t get them.
Anger dulls his intelligence and he forgets what is right. That
means, his knowledge of right and wrong is destroyed. A man is
ruined when his intellect is destroyed.)
The fact is that a man is destroyed when his buddhi is destroyed.
This means, a person is what his buddhi is. When does
buddhinaasha (destruction of the buddhi) happen? It happens
when a person begins to justify wrong actions.
The mind says, ‘This object is very desirable.’
What should be done?
‘It should be procured.’
It cannot be procured ethically.
‘Very well, I will show you the method by which you can procure
it.’
Thus, when the buddhi teaches you a method by which you can
procure something you are not entitled to, it justifies a wrong
desire. When this happens, you must understand that your intellect
has become adulterated and spoilt. And, when right thinking is
destroyed, the person is destroyed too. Bhagwan told Arjuna
clearly:
Kaunte`ya pratijaaneehi na me` bhaktah pranashyati.
(9. 31)
321

---

## Page 322

(O son of Kunti, know it for a fact that My bhakta is never
destroyed.)
Kaunte`ya means, son of Kunti. Kunti is an extraordinary word.
One meaning of ‘Kaunteya’ is ‘the son of Shri Krishna’s aunt,
Kunti’. ‘You are My brother. You are dear to Me.’ If one brother
makes a pledge on behalf of the other, it is as good as his pledge.
Another meaning of kunti is a sharp intellect. The dagger attached
to the nozzle of a rifle is called kunta. ‘You are the son of a
woman whose intellect is very sharp.’
‘Pratijaaneehi’ means, ‘you make a pledge.’
How can anyone make a vow on behalf of another? Nobody has
heard of such a thing! Only a person who feels strongly about
something can take a vow. Bhagwan said, ‘The path of bhakti
allows a bhakta to take a vow on behalf of Bhagwan.’
How is that?
Bhagwan’s nature is such that He eats when His bhaktas feed
Him, and sleeps when they put Him to bed. He lets His bhaktas
sell Him or give Him away in daan. Thus, Bhagwan is controlled
by His bhaktas.
‘Look, Arjuna,’ said Bhagwan. ‘I will not take the vow. You have
to take it for Me.’
‘Why, Krishna? Why won’t You make the pledge?’
‘At present, I am in a very weak position. I have made a vow that
I will not take up arms in the Mahabharata war, but I know that I
will shortly have to break that vow. This will bring Me dishonor.
If I make another vow now, nobody will have any faith in it. That
is why you must make it for Me.’
Arjuna was very good at making and keeping vows. ‘If I don’t do
this today, I will walk into the fire,’ he would say. There is one
episode in the Bhagwat. Arjuna vowed to keep alive the new born
son of a Brahmin. He said he would walk into the fire if he failed.
In the Mahabharata war, he vowed to kill Jayadratha before
sunset, or else walk into a fire. Thus, Arjuna was adept at making
and keeping his pledge.
322

Now, another point – where does Bhagwan frolic? Where does He
wander around? He walked on the Govardhan Mountain, which
was very hard. So, the firmness in a bhakta’s heart is the
Govardhan, and the purity in it is the lake, and the inclination for
Bhagwan that flows continuously is the Jamuna. Bhagwan frolics
in the waters of the Jamunaji, walks on the Mountain, and bathes
in the lake. Shri Krishna is showing us how steadfast Arjuna is, in
his resolve. Bhagwan may fail to keep His vow, but His bhakta
won’t. Arjuna’s vow is to never feel impoverished, and never beg
for anything. This is why Shri Krishna told Arjuna to make the
pledge, ‘Na me` bhaktah pranashyati kaunte`ya pratijaaneehi –
tvam pratijaaneehi pratignaayasva – you take the vow.’
What vow should I take?
‘Na me` bhaktah pranashyati – My bhakta will never be
destroyed.’
Now, see; on one hand Bhagwan says that even the worst sinner
can obtain Him, and on the other hand He says that we must
inculcate sadguna (virtuous qualities) if we want to obtain Him.
Those who have shraddhaa (faith) obtain Bhagwan.
Shraddhadhaanaa matparamaa bhaktaaste`teeva me` priyah.
(12. 20)
(Bhaktas worship Me with love and faith, and follow Dharma.
They are very dear to Me.)
Shraddhaavaan bhajate` yo maam sa me` yuktatamo matah.
(6. 47)
(The Yogi who worships Me continuously with faith is, for Me,
the most superior Yogi.)
On one hand, the door is open for even the worst sinner. You
heard me tell you, ‘If you flout the Shastras you will never obtain
peace and happiness.’ On the other hand Bhagwan says, ‘If you
have a desire to know about Yoga, you have crossed over the
shabdabrahma (the Brahman that is described verbally). The
323

---

## Page 324

Shastras so not apply to you, because you are a Yogi.’ The rules
are to be followed by ordinary people don’t apply to a Yogi. If a
person has obtained Yoga, he is no longer restricted by religious
norms.
Sarvathaa vartamaanopi sa yogee mayi vartate`.
(6. 31)
(The Yogi who sees Me as the Atma in all beings always moves
in Me.)
Sarvathaa vartamaanopi – the purport is that the Gita is certainly
for a Yogi, but it is also for one who wants to know about Yoga,
for one who has sadguna, and for one who is fallen. It is also for a
bhakta and for a Gnani. The Gita is for the benefit of all Creation.
A mantra is spoken during the marriage ceremony. The groom
touches the chest of the bride in full view of all the people, and
says this mantra. It is called the ‘hriday sparsha’ – touching the
heart. The Pundits of today don’t always read this mantra.
Mama vrate` te` hridayam dadhaami
mama chittam anuchittam te` astu.
Mama vaacham e`kamanaa
prajaapatistvaam noonatvam.
(I establish your heart in my resolve. Today onwards, we will both
have the same vrata. Let your mind and mine be one. I will follow
you and you follow me. Listen carefully to what I say.)
What I wanted to explain is that when Shri Krishna and Arjuna sat
together on the battlefield of the Mahabharata, Bhagwan told
Arjuna to let the action of hriday sparsha be done. ‘Geetaa me`
hridayam paartha – Arjuna, the Gita is My heart. It is not a book
or a Shastra. I am giving you My heart, like a friend gives his
heart to his friend or a husband to his wife.’ The Gita is
Bhagwan’s heart. The message of the Gita is Bhagwan giving His
heart.
324

## Page 325

Now, if you want to obtain Bhagwan’s heart, you can do so from
the Gita. When Bhagwan took His heart and placed it in Arjuna’s
body, He said, ‘Whoever hates you hates Me, and whoever
follows you follows Me.’
Bhagwan Shri Krishna had told Sanjay, ‘Go and tell Dhritarashtra
– “Krishno dhananjayasya aatmaa krishnasya aatmaa
dhananjayah.” The name of Krishna’s Atma is Arjuna, and the
name of Arjuna’s Atma is Krishna. Arjuna is what Krishna is, and
Krishna is what Arjuna is.’

Pravachan XXV
A Glimpse of Bhagwan’s excellence in Women.
Bhagwan did not advise Arjuna when he was in a state of
Samadhi – you are aware of this. So, get rid of the impression that
Bhagwan gives Gnan when a person is in deep meditation. It was
not during a Samadhi that the sermon of the Gita was given.
Very well; could it have been given in a state of Sanyas? No;
Arjuna was not in a state of Sanyas either; he was in a state of
extreme mental agitation. He was overcome by his fondness for
his relatives. ‘Yotsyamaanaanave`kshe`ham ya e`te`tra
samaagataah (1. 23) – I will see the Kings who have assembled
here to fight with me.’ So, don’t focus on what your present state
is. You need not be in a Samadhi or in a state of Sanyas to
understand the message of the Gita. The Gita comes into your life
when you are in the midst of daily conflicts, and the ups and
downs of life.
I direct your attention to one point. It is my practice to clarify that
the Gita does not differentiate between the genders, the followers
of Shiva and Vishnu, or Indians and people of other countries.
The Bhagwat Gita is for the good of all Bhagwan’s children, for
whoever has been created by Bhagwan.
Somebody asked me if the Gita says anything specific for women.
The Gita says that the one Paramatma is in all beings:
Eeshvarah sarvabhootaanaam hridde`she`runa tishthati.
(18. 61)
(O Arjuna, the Ishwara is seated in the heart of all beings,
controlling their actions.)
If the Parameshwara is seated in the heart of all beings, won’t He
also be in the heart of the women? Does this exclude the women
and apply only to men?
326

## Page 327

Bhagwan said, ‘Maame`kam sharanam vraja (18. 66) – take
refuge in Me alone.’ Is this meant only for the Brahmins and not
the Shudras? Is it only for the Indians and not for other people? Is
Bhagwan only for Hindus? He is the Master of all, He is
everybody’s antaryaami (abiding in the heart), He is the most
Beloved for all. He is all-knowing and all-powerful. Whatever is
said by Him is for all.
Very well; I will tell you about a childish thought of mine. I used
to read the Gita since I was very young. Thoughts would come to
me, ‘Suppose I am a cow, and Bhagwan is telling me, ‘Niyatam
kuru karma tvam karmajyaayo hyakarmanah (3, 8) – do what the
Shastras say is right for you.’ Or, I am a horse, and He is telling
me, ‘Karmanye` vaadhikaaraste` (2. 8) – you are eligible only to
do the work, not to expect the fruit of your labor.’ That means, I
used to wonder what Bhagwan wanted of me, had I been in the
forms of different species and genders. Bhagwan always has
something to say, and what He says is always for everybody’s
good. See the descriptions given in the Gita for those who have
Tamo guna (lowly tendencies), Rajo guna (mixed tendencies) and
Sattva guna (lofty tendencies). When you separate them you will
see the extent of these descriptions. When you see them
separately, you realize the extent of the description of each.
The fact that Arjuna had the daivee sampadaa (the wealth of
divine qualities) and Duryodhan had the aasuree sampadaa (the
Demonic qualities) is made clear right at the start of the Gita.
Dhritarashtra says, ‘Maamakaah paandavaashchaiva (1. 1) – my
sons and the sons of Pandu’, revealing his partiality. This is where
the two sampadas are shown as separate. Duryodhan orders,
‘Bheeshmame`vaabhirakshantu bhavantah sarva e`va hi (1. 11) –
you are all to guard Bhishma, from whichever position you are.’
He also says, ‘Madarthe` tyaktajeevitaah (1. 9) – they are all
prepared to die for my sake.’ The Gita describes the Daivi and
Asuri sampadas, the three gunas of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas,
Swarga (Heaven) and Narak (hell). It exposes the attachments of
327

## Page 328

human beings. If you want to see your real self, the Gita is like a
mirror par excellence.
From the Gita you can find out whether your food is Sattvik,
Rajasik or Tamasik. You can find out the quality of your intellect
– whether it is lofty, or a combination of good and bad thoughts.
You can get an indication about the realms you will go to after
death, and how strongly you are attached to your relatives and
associates. If you want to see what your worldly interaction is
like, the Gita will tell you. The Gita places your entire character
before you.
Just yesterday, a mother told me, ‘I am not satisfied – I want to
know what the Gita says about the Dharma for women. I want to
know whether the rights of women are less.’ Here you are, then, I
am telling you that Shri Krishna has said that He is a woman. If
you have noticed this, it is very good.
Is He in all women? ‘As the Atma of all, I am in all women.’
Ahamaatmaa gudaake`sha sarvabhootaashayasthitah.
(10. 20)
(O Arjuna, I am the Atma is all beings.)
‘The Atma seated in all beings is Me.’ The tenth chapter describes
both Bhagwan’s Vibhuti (splendor) as well as His Yoga (intrinsic
quality). When you read the tenth chapter, you can place them in
their right slots and find out which are the Vibhuti and which are
the Yoga.
E`taam vibhootim yogam cha mama yo ve`tti tattvatah.
(10. 7)
(One who knows the supreme magnificence of My Vibhuti and
power of Yoga,)
One is His Vibhuti and the other is His Yoga.
Sovikampe`na yoge`na yujyate` naatra sanshaya.
328

---

## Page 329

(10. 7)
(gets My bhakti and gets inseparably attached to Me. There is no
doubt about this.)
To obtain avikampe`na yoga (unshakable union) we need both
Bhagwan’s Vibhuti and His Yoga. Vibhuti is the splendor and
Yoga is that, which is absolutely close to the Atma. For example,
water turns into ice. Ice is the Vibhuti and water is the Yoga.
When the water in a cow comes out as milk, the milk is the
Vibhuti. The sweet juice in grapes is the Vibhuti. Thus, Vibhuti is
to manifest in another form and Yoga is the natural form. You
will see that even speakers are divided in the tenth chapter. Manu
is a speaker of Vibhuti.
Maharshayah sapta poorve` chatvaaro manavsathathaa.
(10. 6)
(The seven Maha Rishis, the four Sanakadis who are even older,
and the fourteen Manus have all been created by My resolve.)
Let us now look at one of Bhagwan’s Vibhutis. This is
extraordinary! ‘My Vibhuti manifests in women.’ Recognize
them. They are signs of Bhagwan’s splendor, that abide in
women. One day, a man brought his unmarried daughter to Guru
Nanak. Guru Nanak kept gazing at the girl. ‘Guru sahib, what are
you looking at?’ he asked. ‘I am admiring Bhagwan’s artistry!’
said Guru Nanak. ‘What a skillful artist Bhagwan is! What a
beautiful girl He has made!’ So, Bhagwan spoke about His
presence in all women.
Keertih shreervakcha naareenaam smritirme`dhaa dritih
kshamaa,
(10. 34)
(I am the keerti [renown], shree [beauty], vaak [sweet and correct
speech], smriti [memory of what is right and proper], me`dhaa [a
329

---

## Page 330

sharp and righteous intellect], dhriti [steadfastness], kshamaa
[forgiveness] in women.)
You can count the Vibhutis. Bhagwan abides in all women in
seven forms. These are His Vibhutis. Bhagwan thought, ‘Let Me
get married.’ Then, He thought, ‘Who will give Me their
daughter?’ So, He first created keerti, revealing His own renown
in the form of a woman, and His kirti gave birth to a daughter. Do
you know the name of Radharani’s mother? It is Kirti. So, kriti
manifested first. Do Bhagwan’s keertan (sing His praises). Listen
to sermons about His greatness, and describe them to others.
Raadhaa – aaraadhanaa (worship) – will be born with these
activities, and be wedded to Bhagwan.
When Bhagwan’s kirti comes into your heart, Radha will manifest
in your heart. See what this means – it means that every woman
should have a good reputation. Bhagwan abides where kirti is.
This is not only for a few selected women; it is for all women.
The meaning of kirti is that a woman should win the praise of all
who know her, as a pure and noble person. People should admire
her for her high ideals and behavior. Nobody should be able to
point a finger at her, or accuse her of anything degrading. It is not
enough for a woman to remain untainted; the purity of her
character must be seen by the society in which she lives. People
should feel that this is a virtuous lady and devoted wife. Such a
lady should be praised by her mother-in-law and father-in-law, by
her brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, by her husband and by
others. Bhagwan Himself is present in the life of such a woman.
She is Bhagawati (the Goddess) incarnate.
The second quality is shri. One meaning of shri is physical beauty,
and one meaning is inner beauty. Only fools think that any woman
who has a fair skin is beautiful. I have seen women whose
complexion is very fair, but their faces are almost repulsive. The
fact is that beauty is a reflection of inner happiness. Color is
separate from form or features. Therefore, the form and features
330

---

## Page 331

also need to be beautiful. A beautiful form is a Vibhuti of
Bhagwan.
A woman should never be proud of her beauty. She should think
that Bhagwan has manifested as the beauty in her form, and
respect Him. Just as she does poojaa (ritual worship of
Bhagwan’s idol), she should do His puja by enhancing the beauty
of her body. She should look at the mirror and get His darshan
(see with reverence), and remove any dirt or stain. However, the
actual beauty of beauty is in the mind, so what is most important
is that the mind should not be dirty. Using cleverness to deceive,
or win some unfair advantage is the dirt of the mind. The mind
should be free of all crookedness. People should be
straightforward in their dealings. The more straightforward a lady
is, the stronger the presence of Bhagwan is in her.
Now see the third point. Bhagwan is present in you, ladies, in the
form of your good reputation, and the purity of your mind. He is
present externally in the beauty of your form and speech. I often
have to stay at people’s houses. The ladies look very beautiful and
speak with great sweetness. However, when they berate their
servants, scold their children, or quarrel with their husbands, their
voices become harsh and grating. Bhagwan abides in the speech
of women. He manifests in the form of Saraswati (the goddess of
learning). The right kind of speech is ‘saaram, sushthu, mitam,
madhuh’. You should not be garrulous. Convey the substance in
brief.
Do you know about the four qualities food should have? One is a
tempting fragrance that fills the kitchen when the food is being
cooked. The second is an attractive appearance that makes the
mouth water. The third is that the food should be nutritious,
giving the body resistance against disease. The fourth quality is
that the one who eats gets pleasure even if he is feeling sad. These
are the four qualities that should be present in our food. They are
called saurabhya (fragrance), saundarya (attractiveness),
saurasya (tastiness), and sauhitya (beneficial). You see that the
Gita even describes food.
331

---

## Page 332

Rasyaah snigdhaah sthiraa hridyaa.
(17. 8)
Rasyaah – the food should be tasty. Sthiraa – the food should not
be so light that you go on eating, or need to eat frequently. This is
not the way of our dharma de`sha (land predominated by
Dharma). This is the way of the bhoga de`sha (land predominated
by indulgence). You will remember the difference in outlook in
the countries where Dharma dominates and where indulgence
dominates. Worship of the mother is the way of the Dharma desh
and worship of the girl friend is the way of the bhoga desh.
So, what you say should be saara – the relevant facts; and sushthu
– elegant; and mitam – speak as little as possible. Even if a person
has a hearty appetite, it is not proper to give him a huge quantity
of rice or rotis. He should be served smaller portions at a time. In
speech, it is not enough to have the cream; a little honey should be
added. ‘Saaram, sushthum, mitam, madhuh’. Madhu means
honey.
How is Draupadi’s speech described? ‘Dharmyam, nyaayam,
sakarunam.’ Draupadi’s words contained Dharma and justice and
compassion. It had equanimity of outlook, and was
straightforward. It had magnanimity. It is said, ‘Boliye` to taba
jaba bolibe` kee reeti jaano – speak when you have learnt the art
of speaking.’ The vasheekarana mantra that enables a person to
influence others abides in speech. A woman’s speech should be
such that it wins the heart of whoever listens.
Let the men’s bodies be hard, let their hearts be hard, and let their
speech be hard on occasion. They belong to Shiva; but a woman is
the image of tenderness. She is gentleness itself. She is the
presiding deity of all that is gracious. She is Laxmi. Beauty dwells
in her form and Saraswati dwells in her speech. Her renown
spreads everywhere. Bhagwan manifests in the form of a woman.
You have seen what else the Gita says –
‘smritirme`dhaadhritihkshamaa.’ These four should be present in
the life of a woman. These four are internal virtues, whereas the
332

---

## Page 333

three mentioned before are external qualities. This shloka is from
the tenth chapter. Now, suppose the mother-in-law tells the lady to
make soup for her, and the husband asks her to sew a button on
his shirt, and both keep waiting, wondering when their work will
be done? ‘Oh, I fell asleep! I forgot what you had said.’ This
excuse of helplessness is not in keeping with a woman’s nature. A
woman’s nature has komalataa (tenderness) and smriti (memory);
which means, Bhagwan manifests in her body. Look, Arjuna did
not have smriti. You know that, don’t you? What did he say after
listening to the whole Gita?
Nashto mohah smritirlabdhvaa tvatprasaadaanmayaachyuta.
(18. 73)
(Krishna! By Your Grace, my delusion is destroyed, and I have
obtained smriti.)
Arjuna obtained smriti after hearing the whole Gita, but smriti is
present in the life of every woman since birth. If a woman forgets
what her kartavya (duty) is, it is due to one of two causes. One
cause is aalasya (indolence). She remembers what she should do,
but keeps putting it off. The other cause is pramaada
(forgetfulness). Pramad means that she actually forgets. It is a
paapa to forget your duty. People forget, and then they tell others
that it slipped their mind. Where smriti is present naturally in a
woman, Bhagwan is present there. It is as –
Vrishninaam vaasude`vosmi.
(10. 37)
(Among the people of the Vrishni clan, I am Vasudev.)
In which form is Bhagwan, in the lineage of Yadu? He is in the
form of Vasudev Shri Krishna. In which form is He in women?
He is in the form of smriti and me`haa. Medha means the ability
to retain what you are taught. This time, I went to see a television
factory. I noticed that all the workers were women. I asked the
333

---

## Page 334

owner – who had taken me to see the factory – what the reason
was, for employing only women. ‘Swamiji,’ he said, ‘It has been
established psychologically that men tend to get bored with
routine work, and become careless. Women, on the other hand,
are used to cooking and feeding their children every day. The
making of these sets entails fixing ten kinds of wires repeatedly.
Women continue doing this tedious task diligently, hour after
hour.’
It is to the credit of women that they can work attentively for long
hours, doing the same work repeatedly; whereas men get bored
and lax. This is what the owner of the factory had told me, as he
showed me round. ‘Women are very smart. If you show them
something once, they at once grasp and remember it.’ The word
‘medha’ in Sanskrit, means ‘dhee – dharanaavati me`dhaa’ – the
intellect that sustains. A person has medha when he grasps what
he is taught and remembers it all his life, improving upon it
innovatively.
Now, see the forms of Bhagwan in the forms of women. Her kirti,
beauty, speech, smriti, buddhi-medha, and her dhriti. This dhriti is
amazing. The Ishwara’s greatest form is in our life is dhriti. A
person whose life has no dhriti can get no respect. Dhriti means to
stop, to hold on to. See what dhriti is –
Dhrityaa yayaa dhaarayate` manahpraane`ndriyakriyaa,
yoge`naavyabhichaarinyaa dhritih saa paartha saatvikee.
(18. 33)
(O Arjuna, when a person has the power to hold on to meditation
and control the activities of his mind, breath, and senses, that
dhriti is called a Sattvik dhriti.)
Dhriti has three grades – the Sattvik dhriti, the Rajasik Dhriti, and
the Tamasik dhriti. There was one man who had formed a habit of
lamenting, no matter what happened. One day he had a dream,
and began to weep about what he saw in the dream!
334

---

## Page 335

Yayaa svapnam bhayam shokam vishaadam madame`va cha,
na vimunchati durme`dhaa dhritih saa paartha taamasee.
(18. 35)
(O Arjuna, the dhriti of a wicked man does not allow him to give
up sleep, fear, anxiety, sorrow and intoxication; this is a Tamasi
dhriti.)
What is the characteristic of an intellect that is predominantly
Tamo guni? It is to hold on to grief, fear, distress, or intoxication
that comes into a person’s life. Such a person keeps lamenting
about his misfortunes and suffering, saying that he is an
unfortunate person. That means, Tamasi dhriti is that, by which a
person keeps durguna (bad tendencies) in his life. And, what is
the Rajasi (mixed tendency) dhriti?
Yayaa tu dharmakaamaarthaandhrityaa dhaarayate`rjuna.
(18. 34)
(The dhriti by which a person attaches himself to the fruits of his
good actions is Rajasi dhriti.)
A person who has Rajasi driti holds on to activity, Dharma, and
indulgences. He vows to never give up any of them.
And, what is Sattvik dhriti? It is essential for everyone to have
Sattvik dhriti in their life. Suppose you hear someone’s discourse
and say, ‘Let whatever happens, happen. Some words that should
not have been said slipped out; so what?’ No, my brother, you
should have the ability to hold your tongue.
I have a student who is a Shastri (learned in Sanskrit grammar).
He gives me a lot of love. He demonstrated his learning by
writing ‘khura-kamala’ (lotus-like hooves), instead of ‘paada
kamala’ (lotus-like feet). It is not that there is any lack of
goodwill, or regard. The hooves of horses, oxen, and goats are
called ‘khura’, and the feet of Bhagwan or a Saint are called
‘paada kamala’ or ‘charana kamala’. What this shows is that he
lacks command over his verbal expressions. ‘Dhritya yayaa
335

---

## Page 336

dhaarayate` manahpraane`ndriyakriyaah.’ If your mind starts
thinking of, or doing something wrong, stop it at once. You don’t
need to listen to any doctor about this. If a doctor tells you to
allow your wife or son to do whatever they feel like, and that you
should say whatever comes into your head, he is making you lose
your senses; he wants to medicate you.
Dhrityaa yayaa dhaarayate` manahpraane`ndriyakriyaah. The
ability to control the actions of the mind, praana (breath; life
spirit) and senses, is called the Sattvik dhriti. You should not be
carried away by wrong urges. It should not be that you go to
someone’s house and succumb to the temptation of stealing
something, saying what should not be said, or eating what should
not be eaten. When any person – man or woman – has the dhriti
shakti to control their intake and indulgences, it is called the
Sattvik dhriti. Don’t allow your senses to indulge in anything
improper. Shri Udiya Babaji Maharaj even forbade us to say or
listen to anything frivolous, to look at things meaninglessly, or do
anything that had no purpose. People sit shaking their legs or
hands restlessly. All useless actions, including listening, looking
and talking, should be given up, if you want your mind to be
focused.
Make dhriti avyabhichaarinee (chaste). How can this be done? It
can be achieved by saadhanaa (effort for spiritual progress). You
have to form a habit.
Yoge`naavyabhichaarinyaa dhritih saa paartha saattvikee.
Bhagwan is where Sattvik dhriti is, but He says that dhriti should
be present in men as well as women. Even so, the presence of
dhriti is the special quality women have. It is their special
attribute, their special Vibhuti.
See another point: you will not hear of such a Vibhuti anywhere
else. The woman is one, and Bhagwan says, ‘I am present in her
in seven forms. I abide in every woman in the forms of renown,
beauty, sweet speech, an instinctive memory of what is the right
336

---

## Page 337

thing to do, an intellectual ability to grasp and retain things, self-
restraint, and forgiveness.’
Don’t punish every wrong doer, because a little of the punishment
comes to the one who punishes. If a woman does not forgive her
child, or a younger brother-in-law for some impudence, it will
create friction in the family. If she complains to her mother-in-law
or husband about petty matters, it will lead to quarrels. A woman
should forget such lapses. If the father-in-law eyes her and she
complains to her husband, or if the husband looks at another
woman and she starts quarrelling with him, it is not conducive to
peace and harmony. Forgiveness is the sadguna (good quality) of
a woman. She should not let her mind be sullied over small
incidents. Kshamaa (forgiveness) is a form of the Prithvi (earth).
A woman is forgiving, like Mother Earth. She has the depth of the
ocean, and she is as purifying as the Ganga. For the wicked, she is
like a blazing fire, and she gives freshness to all, just as the wind
gives life to all. Like space, she gives people space. This is why
Bhagwan said that He is present in women as not one, but seven
Vibhutis. We read this in the Gita, but it is mentioned with great
brevity. It is given like a formula that signifies great things.
We read – ‘Keertih shreervak cha naareenaam smritirme`dhaa
dhritih kshamaa’. But, we never give much thought to it. In these
words, Bhagwan is telling us, ‘House Me within yourself. I am in
you in these seven forms. I abide in your tongue, in your dhriti,
your kshama, your smriti, and your pure kirti.’ Thus, this little
Gita that contains only seven hundred shlokas – of which forty or
fifty are purely historical – conveys many profound truths.
A gentleman once said to me, ‘I believe in every letter of the Gita
and try to inculcate it in my life.’ Hearing this, another gentleman
asked, ‘Do you wish to inculcate the characteristics of the Tamo
guna (lowly tendencies)? Do you want the Asuri sampada
(demonic qualities)?’ My brother, inculcate what the Gita tells
you to cultivate. Don’t inculcate every word thoughtlessly. Let go
of what the Gita tells you to give up, and adopt what the Gita tells
you to adopt.
337

## Page 338

What I mean to say is that the Gita is a staircase that takes your
whole existence to a higher plane. It is like a small child losing his
way in the lanes, and his mother calls down to him from above,
guiding him home. When we were very young, we would lose our
way among the tall sugar cane plants. We grew up in villages, not
big cities. My grandfather would call our, ‘Look; I am standing
here. Come straight out on this side,’ and I would find my way to
him.
Thus, Bhagwan is calling out to those who are lost in this
interactive world. The Gita is His compassion, the voice of His
motherly love that is the same for all His children. The Gita has
mamataa (motherly love) but it is not without samataa
(equanimity towards all). It contains karma, but has no selfish
desires. It has Gnan, but not for attachments, aversions, or pride.
Bhagwan has sent such a Gita to bestow good fortune on us. I will
tell you more tomorrow.

Pravachan XXVI
Empty Your Mind
It seems, at first, that Arjuna is trying to inspect his own mind.
Bhramateeva cha me` manah.
(1. 30)
(My mind is wandering.)
You may remember what is written in the first chapter.
Dristve`mam svajanam krishna yuyutsum samupasthitam,
seedanti mama gaatraani mukham cha parishushyati.
Ve`pathushcha shareere` me` romaharshashcha jaayate`,
gaandeevam srinsate` hastaattvakchaiva paridahyate`.
(1. 28 – 30)
(O Krishna, my limbs weaken at the sight of my own people
gathered here to fight. My throat is dry and my body trembles. My
bow, Gandiva, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.)
All these are signs of illness. Now, if I tell a saadhaka (spiritual
seeker) that the trembling of his body is due to his mental
condition, he will not be willing to believe me. He will ask, ‘Are
you trying to make a fool of me? It is my body that is trembling,
not my mind!’
And, see this: ‘Romaharshashcha jaayate` - my hair stands on
end.’ ‘Gaandeevam sransate` hastaat – the Gandiva slips from
my hand.’ This is physical weakness. ‘Tvakchaiva paridahyate` -
my skin is burning.’ All the symptoms indicate a need to see a
doctor. Shri Krishna should have told Arjuna to consult some
specialist. However, Arjuna does not observe only his physical
symptoms. He says, ‘Bhramateeva cha me` manah - my mind
seems to be wandering.’ He does not say that his mind is
wandering, he says that his mind seems to be wandering.

One gentleman was very particular about the accuracy of what he
said. I asked him, ‘What is the time?’
He took out his watch and thrust it at me to show it to me, and
said, ‘According to my watch, at this moment the time is six
seconds and seven minutes past five.’ Is this not an exaggeration
of Satya (truthfulness)? Arjuna could have said that his mind was
wandering, but he said that his mind seemed to be wandering.
Na cha shaknomyavasthaatum bhramateeva cha me` manah.
(1. 30)
(I am unable to stand, because my mind seems to be wandering.)
So, what is the bhraanti (mistaken impression) of the mind?
Bhraanti does not mean a mistake. Let us move to the nature of
the Sanskrit language. If you say, ‘I am going for bhramana (a
walk; a tour)’ it does not mean, ‘I am going to make a mistake.’
People say, ‘My mind was in Calcutta.’ That does not mean that
the mind had left the body and gone to Calcutta. It means that
thoughts about Calcutta engrossed the mind. It is a bhranti to think
that the mind goes anywhere.
Very well; suppose you say, ‘Calcutta came into my mind,’ it is
certain that the city did not move, and nor did the mind move
from where they were. Both remained in their rightful place. A
man may say, ‘A lady has come into my heart,’ but no lady has
actually come into his heart, nor has his heart left his body to go
to her. ‘Oh, my mind wanders in the era of the Mahabharata.’ My
friend, the present times are before you, and your mind is here.
The era of the Mahabharata is like a dream state. Your mind is
filled with the things you have heard. Historians express doubts
about the Mahabharata war being a fact, and your mind is filled
with the Mahabharata!
So, neither does the mind leave the present and go into the past,
nor does it leave the present to go into the future. That is all
imagination. A young man came to a Mahatma. ‘Maharaj, I have
340

---

## Page 341

seen a lady. She has come into my eyes. She now abides in my
eyes.’
‘How is it that your eyes did not burst?’ asked the Mahatma. ‘The
lady is five feet tall, and your eyes are barely two inches. If a
woman were to go into your eye, it would burst! Neither has the
lady come into your eyes, nor have your eyes gone into the lady.
The lady and your eyes are both where they should be.’
Calcutta is where it should be. The past is gone, and the future is
yet to come. It is in your Atma, which is the essence of Gnan, that
you imagine these things. You are as you are, where you are, and
in the present. ‘Bhramateeva me` manah – my mind seems to be
in a whirl.’ This is why, when giving Arjuna advise about Yoga,
Bhagwan said –
Aatmasanstham manahkritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t.
(6. 25)
(You should have a steadfast intellect that establishes your mind
in the Paramatma, so that it does not think about anything else.)
On the one hand, I told you about, ‘Bhramateeva cha me` manah’
and on the other hand, here is something just the opposite:
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t – this is
such a simple Yoga that it is like a mother telling her child, ‘My
child, play in your own home. Don’t play at our neighbor’s
house.’ It is as simple as that!
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t – it is like
a mother saying, ‘My child, stop playing now. Rest awhile.’ A
doctor had once told me that the longer babies sleep, the better
they grow. Growth takes place when babies sleep. That is why
little babies should be made to sleep eighteen hours a day.
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye` - means,
‘laalaye` chittabaalakam’. The mind is like a child. It has to be
controlled with gentleness. Don’t let it go on a road that is bad; it
is your baby. A couple of days back, a lady from a traditional,
well to do family came to meet me. ‘Nobody in our house uses
341

---

## Page 342

bad language,’ she said. ‘Yet my son – who is only four years old
– uses words that are shocking!’ I told her to observe who his
playmates were. Just as we are careful that our children don’t pick
up bad habits from people whose lifestyle is very different from
ours, we have to protect our mind from wrong influences.
There is a boy from a good family. He learnt to steal things when
he was only ten or twelve. By the time he was fifteen, his servants
had taught him all the wrong things, including drinking. They
would take money from him, offering to bring him whatever he
wanted.
So, guard your mind as you would guard a small child. Let it play
in its own house with you. Give it all comforts and conveniences,
but don’t let it get contaminated with wrong associations.
Yashoda Maiya would tell Shri Krishna, ‘No, my son, you have
played enough. Go to sleep now. Rest for a while.’
You should allow your mind to get some rest. And,
aatmasanstham manah kritvaa – let your mind sleep on the bed of
the Atma. ‘Na kinchidapi chintaye`t.’ Stop making your mind
work without rest. Is this easy, or is it difficult? Even if you
extend help to someone, it is difficult to stay in his house; staying
in your own house is not difficult. It is difficult to take help from
someone else, or eat food at someone else’s house; it is easy to eat
the food in your own house.
If your mind wants bhoga (indulgences), it will have to be
dependent upon others. It will have to go to other people’s houses,
to markets, and restaurants. But if your mind does not want bhoga,
then Yoga is always in your own house. In Yoga, you just have to
give up everything that is outside; but in bhoga you have to get
everything from outside. Getting external objects means
dependence, but you are not dependent on any other when you are
in your own house.
When you think that you will be happy only when you have this
lady or gentleman, child or mother, brother or friend, you are
removing happiness from your heart and placing it outside. How
long can you keep happiness outside? How long can you stay
342

---

## Page 343

outside? Ultimately, you will have to come home. Therefore,
‘aatmananstham manah kritvaa’ – the essence of Yoga is to not
send your mind into the external world.
Yoga means independence. It is a state where you are not
dependent on any object, individual, place or time. It means
absolute freedom from being dependent on any other factor. It
means losing yourself into your Self. Shri Krishna told Arjuna,
‘Arjuna, your mind goes to Duryodhana; it goes to Drona,
Bhishma Pitamah, and Karna. This is your mind getting lost.
Establish yourself in your Self, and don’t think about anything.’
A man says, ‘Let the mind go where it wants; after all, it doesn’t
really go anywhere. If your mind were to physically leave your
body, it would be a different matter, but it doesn’t really do so.
Bhramateeva cha me` manah. It just seems as though the mind
has gone somewhere. What objection do you have to this false
rising of the mind?’
Come; let us study this a little. Arjuna placed this problem before
Shri Krishna. What I wish to place before you today is that the
memories of past incidents are not a repetition of those events.
They are mere memories, even though they shine as real. They are
called ‘sfurnaa’. The scenes of far away places are also a sfurna,
and so are the other things that occupy the mind. The fact is that
the whole world is created in your mind. The good and the bad are
both created in your mind.
If you let go of your mind, it will follow you. It will tell you to
accompany it. You should be aware of one thing. When you try to
follow your mind, neither do you go anywhere, nor does your
mind. It is like going in a dream. You get lost in a dream. So –
Yatra yatra mano yaati tatra tatra samaadhayah.
This is also a dream of yours.
When Arjuna found himself troubled, Bhagwan told him to stop
thinking about others. ‘Maharaj,’ said Arjuna, ‘I cannot control
my thoughts.’

Chanchalam hi manah krishna pramaathibalavaddridham,
tasyaaham nigraham manye` vaayoriva sudushkaram.
(6. 34)
(‘O mighty-armed Arjuna,’ said Bhagwan. ‘There is no doubt that
the mind is restless and fickle. It is indeed difficult to control the
mind, but this can be done through practice and detachment.)
Arjuna was an ambidextrous warrior who fought equally well
with both hands. Such a warrior is called ‘savyasaachi’. Arjuna
could hit an unseen target as well as a target that was clearly
visible. This is evident in the episode of Draupadi. It is the same
Arjuna who is now talking about the restlessness of the mind. The
meaning of chanchala is that it is like the shifting shadows made
by a flickering lamp. The mind is equally unsteady. If you sit by
the sea at sunset, the clouds seem to form images. You may
imagine the figure of Hanumanji carrying his mace, or a
mountain. You may see the image of Shiva on his bull or Vishnu
on Garudaji. Some cloud formations will look like Indra on his
chariot. You can imagine a variety of images in the clouds.
However, if your heart burns with love for your lady-love, you
will not see the form of any Devta! You will see the form of your
sweetheart. Chanchal indicates that just as people who do Yagyas
imagine celestial nymphs dancing in the flames, and people
imagine Devtas in cloud formations, the mind sees mental images.
To remember various names and forms is chanchalataa (being
restless; unsteady). Imagine that Shri Krishna said, ‘Let them be.
What harm can these mental images do?’
‘They are harmful for me, Maharaj,’ said Arjuna. ‘The mind
batters my body.’ The mind asks the body what it is doing here,
telling it to go to Calcutta. When we were children, traveling in a
train, we would chant, ‘Dhara de` paisa chala kalakuttaa (put
down the money and go to Calcutta). This was not the train
speaking; it was our mind.
344

## Page 345

Then, India became Independent. We had a Punditji who was
strongly opposed to Independence. I had become a Sanyasi long
before India became Independent. When the train came from
Vrindavan to Mathura, Punditji would say, ‘Even the sound of the
train is off-key ever since India became independent!’ The sound
of the train had not changed in any way; it was the effect of
Punditji’s mind.
Thus, pramaathee means that the mind allows a person no peace.
It tells you, ‘You will get tasty food here, you will get great
beauty there. You will earn a good income in this place.’ The
mind batters the body.
In that case, you should catch the mind.
But, the mind is extremely strong. How can you catch and control
someone who is extremely strong?
Well, then, persuade it. Fold your hands and cajole it.
The mind is very obstinate. It refuses to listen to reason.
These days, neither can a husband control his wife, nor can a wife
control her husband. If one of them wants to go somewhere, can
the other stop him or her? Friends can’t stop each other from
doing what they want, fathers can’t control their sons, and Gurus
can’t control their disciples. When the mind wants to do
something, it is ‘pramaathee balavaddridham tasyaaham
nigraham.’ Who will discipline it? Arjuna said, ‘You are the
Ishwara, and You are advising me –
Sparshaankritvaa bahirbaahyaanshchakshushchaivaantare`
bhruvoh,
Praanaapaanau samou kritvaa naasaabhyaantarachaarinaau.
Yate`ndriyamano buddhirmunirmokshaparaayanah.
(5. 27, 28)
(The person who keeps external objects out of his mind, keeps his
vision fixed on the center of his forehead between the eyebrows,
keeps his breathing even, has conquered his senses, mind and
intellect, and has an urge only for liberation – such a Yogi has
become free of desires, fear and anger.)
345

## Page 346

You tell me to leave external objects outside, and be established in
my Self, but this is not possible. You are the Ishwara; remain the
Ishwara. I am a jeeva (Atma attached to a body); I will remain a
jeeva. The question of controlling the mind is very difficult. I
cannot do it.’
Now, had Shri Krishna told Arjuna that he was being faint-
hearted, or that there was no such thing as the mind, would it have
satisfied Arjuna? Certainly not; even though it is a fact that there
is no such object. It is the mind that makes the body suffer, it is
the mind that gives comfort to the body, and it is the mind that
makes the body dance to its piping. No body goes to Narak (Hell).
That means, the mind takes on the forms of Narak and Swarga
(Heaven). It is born, like dreams. Just as we become something
else in a dream, the mind assumes different forms. There is no
such thing as happiness and sorrow – it is just the play of the
mind.
I searched extensively for my mind. I searched for years, but did
not find it anywhere. The fact is that some of our habits are called
the mind, some of our sanskaara (subtle subconscious
impressions) are called the mind, and some of our beliefs are
called the mind. Where have we searched, for the mind? What is
the length and breadth of the mind? It is the mind that creates
length and breadth. I enquired how old the mind is, I found that it
is the mind that creates time. It turns one minute into six months,
and six months into one minute. We never know the passing of
time when we sleep. A single night of sorrow seems six months
long. This is the creation of the mind. The length and breadth of
the mind cannot be measured. It contains an ant as well as an
elephant; a forest as well as a mountain. The mind has no form or
shape. You cannot say that it is red or blue or yellow. The mind
sees other forms, the dimensions of objects, and their age.
You believe that I have come to Bombay to give sermons; and
that I have no mission, and no desire to proselytize. I have been
initiated into a tradition where I can, if I feel so inclined, give
knowledge to someone who has an earnest desire for Gnan; a
346

---

## Page 347

person who has done some tyaaga (renunciation), has vairaagya
(detachment), and titikshaa (an ability to endure hardship), and
has rendered a year or two of service. Or else, I need not.
It is not the tradition in Paramartha (attainment of the Supreme) to
go from house to house, as artists do. Gnan is given only to an
earnest jigyaasu (seeker of the ultimate truth), and that, too after
testing him. A Brahmin has to render at least one year of service.
A Kshatriya (warrior caste) two years, and a Vaishya (trader
caste) for three years. Businessmen are used to dubious dealings.
Please don’t mind my saying this, but even after three years’
interaction, the true character of a Vaishya is not always revealed.
The Vaishyas are very good at hiding their thoughts and
intentions.
Narayana! Thus, I searched for years for my mind, whether it
stays inside the body or out of it, what its color is, what its weight
is, etc. I am telling you truly – there is no such thing as the mana
(mind). It is a conglomeration of subtle subconscious impressions,
habits and lifestyle that you have developed, which you accept as
the Gnan in you.
And, Bhagwan also told Arjuna, ‘Asanshaya – without doubt.
Yes, My child, you are quite right.’ Why did He say this? People
who consider themselves very important feel offended if anyone
disagrees with them. They shut their mind to further dialogue on
the matter. So, Shri Krishna accepted what Arjuna said about the
mind being obstinate and difficult to control.
There was a Mahatma. He would go to a Seth (wealthy
businessman) and do Satsang (have spiritual discussions). He
would sit with his hands folded respectfully. One day I asked him
why he, who was a true Mahatma, did this. ‘Look,’ he explained.
‘Whether a pumpkin falls on a sickle or a sickle falls on a
pumpkin, it is the pumpkin that will be cut; not the sickle. The
modern Seths do not render service by making us their Guru, but
they render service by making us their disciple. I want service
from this Seth, by whichever method I can get it.’ This is exactly
347

---

## Page 348

what he said. I can even tell you his name if you want. It is
Prabhudutta Brahmachariji. He had a great sense of humor.
So, then, Bhagwan says, ‘Asanshayam mahaabaaho. Your arms
are very strong. You are not an incompetent weakling.
Asanshayam mahaabaaho mano durnigraham chalam – you face
a great fighter.’ Durnigraham – difficult to capture. Chalam –
moving quickly. Arjuna was describing how the mind batters the
body.
Chanchalam hi manah krishna pramaathibalavaddridham,
tasyaaham nigraham manye` vaayoriva sudushkaram.
(6. 34)
It is true that the mind is difficult to control, and also very restless.
Shri Krishna acknowledges these two points, but ignored the other
three points made by Arjuna, about the mind. He told Arjuna that
the mind could not succeed in battering a great warrior like him.
He bolstered Arjuna’s faith in his own strength. ‘The strength of
the mind is your own strength. It is not the strength of anyone
else.’
But, how can it be controlled?
Grihyate` - you can capture it.
How?
Through abhyaasa (practice) and vairaagya (detachment). Shri
Krishna did not give His own opinion. He quoted the ‘Yoga
Darshan’. He spoke from the viewpoint of the Shastras.
Abhyaase`na tu kaunte`ya vairaagye`na cha grihyate`.
(6. 35)
(The mind can be controlled with practice and detachment.)
If you practice doing something for a week, do it for two weeks,
and then for a month. Your mind will be mastered. The meaning
of abhyasa is to form a habit of what you want. Inculcate good
habits to replace bad ones.
348

---

## Page 349

There was a Mahatma with whom I used to do Satsang. One day
he asked me if I knew what abhyasa meant. He used to explain
things in simple rustic terms. I can explain any Sanskrit word in
simple language, too. The Mahatma told me that abhyasa means
‘Duharaunee’ – to repeat. If you don’t know the correct
pronunciation of a word, say it repeatedly. When I was eight, I
had learnt the whole ‘Muhurta Chintamani’ by heart. I would take
my maalaa (rosary) in may hand, and recite one shloka a hundred
and eight times. It would be imprinted firmly on my memory.
Then I would go on to the next shloka. Thus, abhyasa means to
repeat something until it becomes a habit. Nobody is born
knowing everything. My tongue became habituated to the shlokas
when I recited them a hundred and eight times each.
Abhyasa means touching repeatedly, with the mind, that which
you wish to obtain. Do you want Krishna? Touch Him with your
mind. See Him stand so enticingly with His flute in His hand. Do
you want the niraakaara (formless Brahman)? Aum has no form.
Go on repeating what you want. People say that this is very
difficult. I once told a Mahatma, ‘The pranayama you have taught
me is very difficult.’
‘Look,’ he said. ‘You are young, you are a Brahmin, and you are
learned. If you can’t do it, do you expect an animal to do this
pranayama?’
So, don’t get disheartened. Don’t feel dejected. Have hope, and go
on doing your saadhanaa (effort for spiritual progress) day after
day. It should not be that you do sadhana for a couple of days and
then become impatient for results.
People ask me, ‘For how many days should I do this sadhana?’
‘What is your hurry?’ I ask.
‘I have to attend to my shop.’
That means, the shop is of paramount importance to him. He
wants to obtain the Ishwara and then go to his shop! That is not
the way, my brother. ‘Abhyaase`na tu kaunte`ya’ – go on
repeating what you wish to obtain. You will find that it has
become a habit, and it is called ‘abhyasa.’
349

## Page 350

Vairagya means to not fight with people. A young man came to
Vrindavan with his wife. If his wife wanted to go to the bathroom,
he would not let her go. ‘You are my wife. You must obey me.’
He would not let her eat when she was hungry. ‘You are a devoted
wife, so obey me. Don’t eat.’ People complained to me. I asked
the man why he was behaving so foolishly.
‘I have no attachment for my wife, Maharaj,’ he explained. ‘I
want to behave in such a way that she stops coming to me.’ Now,
vairagya does not mean ruining a marriage. The meaning of
vairagya is to let the world go on as it is. Let a doctor practice his
medicine. Let a Judge give his judgment. Let Yudhishthira do his
Yagya. Let the sun shine. We should occupy ourselves with our
work. It is not that Indra gives up Swarga because you want him
to be a vairaagee (renunciate). A soldier should remain a soldier.
Let others do their duty and you do yours. Don’t interfere with
what others do, and go on your way. This is called ‘vairagya’.
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t means,
let the world remain as it is, and you sit in your Self.
‘I can’t sit still, Maharaj.’
Then, practice sitting still – ‘abhyaase`na tu kaunte`ya’. Even
though I have such fat legs, I can sit in a siddha asana or padma
asana whenever I want, because I have the abhyasa. But, I am not
telling you about Yogic postures or pranayama. I am telling you to
change the habits of your mind.
How is that achieved?
You say that you want to meditate for three hours. You should sit
for only two minutes daily for the first week, without letting any
other thoughts enter your mind. Sit for five minutes daily in the
second week, and ten minutes in the third week. Practice
meditating daily for ten minutes for the next one month. Then,
meditate for fifteen minutes in the month after that. In the third
month, you should meditate for twenty minutes, and twenty five
minutes in the following month. By the sixth month you will be
meditating for thirty minutes every day. Don’t be in a hurry to
increase the time. Thus, abhyasa means to do something again and
350

---

## Page 351

again, over a long period of time, and to do it with faith. The truth
is that there are no inanimate object called the mind; nor is the
mind an animate object. The mind has no existence. It is the
relationship with Gnan that is called the mind.
Yadartham prateeyamaanam manah iti grihyate`. The relationship
of the Atma – which is the essence of Gnan – with sense objects,
is called the mana (mind).
Very well, Sir, I have no relation with anything. Only I exist.
There is no mind.
This is the bodha (knowledge; awareness) of the asanga aatmaa –
the unattached Atma. The knowledge of the advay aatmaa – the
non-dual Atma – is separate. The knowledge that the Atma is
unattached, is obtained through Yoga and vive`ka (separating the
Atma from everything else). The Atma is unattached; unrelated to
anything. And, Vedanta gives the knowledge of the advay Atma.
The non-dual Atma can only be known through Vedanta.
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t –
establish your mind in your Self, without thinking of any object.
Yesterday I had told you that a lot of effort is needed to get bhoga.
You need objects and you need people. Your senses need to be
strong enough to be able to enjoy sensual pleasures, and you need
to have the inclination for these pleasures. Else, how can you
enjoy them? And, your intellect should confirm that the
indulgence is appropriate, otherwise later on, you will feel a sense
of disgust. If the intellect does not feel that the bhoga is ethically
permissible, it will revolt; tomorrow, if not today. Then you will
feel an acute aversion. So it is necessary that your intellect
approves of your indulgences. Thus, we see that bhoga involves
considerable effort.
People do not realize the extent of their slavery. They go from
house to house, wherever bhoga is available, just like to dogs that
follow anyone who gives them food. In Yoga, however, there is
no effort. Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa no kinchidapi chintaye`t.
In Yoga you need nothing – no object, no individual, and no need
for the senses to have strength. Yoga has independence, and the
351

---

## Page 352

fruit of Yoga is supreme independence. People keep talking about
sukha (happiness). Some believe that they will get sukha when
they win a legal dispute, and some believe that they will get sukha
when they have a beautiful house. Happiness does not lie in such
things. ‘Svaatantryam paramam sukham – sarvam paravasham
dukham’ – being independent is supreme happiness and being
ruled by another is sorrow. The more dependent we are, the
greater is our sorrow.
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa no kinchidapi chintaye`t. The
Bhagwat also has a commentary on this. It means that you should
remove three things from your mind. The first thing is the feeling,
‘I am the master of my mind.’ Let go of this vanity. The second
point is, let go of the urge that your mind should dwell on only
one object. Let go of the object on which you want your mind to
linger. Let there be no object before or after the mind. The third
point is that there should be no raaga-dve`sha (attachment-
aversion) in your mind. ‘Na kinchidapi chintaye`t.’
You are not the master of your mind, there is no object that is dear
to your mind, and your mind has no attachment or aversion to
anything in this world. This is the interpretation of the Bhagwat.
The effect of this is that the light that illuminates you mind will
fade out, like the flame that dies when there is no more oil in the
lamp. The mind stops showing you all the worldly objects without
your having to do any asana or pranayama.
Nirvaanamrichhati mano sahasaa yathaarthee. The mind is
snuffed out; it dies. When the mind’s light is turned off, you no
longer see the world. The saakshee chaitanya (the pure
consciousness that is the uninvolved observer) is separated from
the interactive world. Na kinchidapi chintaye`t.
The next this is, ‘I will attach my mind to something or other;
what should I attach it to?’ The Gita gives you both kinds of
viewpoints. Mayye`va mana aadhatsva’ is one viewpoint. Place
you mind in the Paramatma. Here, the word ‘e`va’ is significant.
‘Mayye`va mana aadhatsva mayi buddhim nive`shaya,
352

---

## Page 353

nivasishyasi mayye`va ata oordhvam na sanshayah.
(12. 8)
(Place your mind in Me, and attach your intellect to Me. Then you
will dwell in Me. There is no doubt about this.)
Mayye`va buddhim nive`shaya e`va – ‘eva’ comes before and also
after, so place your mind in Bhagwan. Now see; to do that, we
have to catch Bhagwan with our mind, and this may result in our
losing our mind, since it is independent. Therefore, by using the
word ‘aadhatsva’ (place), Bhagwan indicates, ‘Hand it over to
Me.’ As long as we use our strength to place our mind in
Bhagwan, there is scope for laxity. The mind may come back to
us, and our efforts will not bear fruit. So, buddhi nive`shaya’ (let
you intellect be immersed in Me) is also needed. The fact is that
the mind is ruled by Bhagwan. In the buddhi, the fact is that the
intellect understands the situation as it is. The buddhi does not
reveal anything that is absent; it reveals only what is.
There is a tamas – darkness – in the buddhi of human beings, that
hides the fact that our mind is in Bhagwan’s lap.
Aham sarvasya prabhavah mattah sarvam pravartate`.
(10. 8)
(I am the cause of Creation. All effort is because of Me.)
The mind is created by Bhagwan and is also propelled by Him.
Where is the mind created? It is created in the Parameshwara.
And, who propels the mind? It is the Parameshwara.
Eeshvarah sarvabhootaanaam hridde`she`rjuna tishthati,
bhraamayan sarvabhootaani yantraaroodhaani maayayaa.
(18. 61)
(O Arjuna, the body is like a machine. The Ishwara is seated in
the heart of all the forms, using His Maya to make them to what
they do.)

Bhagwan is the cause of the mind.
E`tasmaat jaayate` praanah manah sarve`ndriyaani cha. The
mind is created from of the five elements, and the five elements
are created directly from the Parameshwara. This is the order of
the descent. Another opinion is that the mind descends straight
from the Parameshwara. And, when we see from the viewpoint of
Bhagwan, this creation is called ‘anirvachaneeya’ – that, which
cannot be defined. Was the mind created from the five subtle
matters called the ‘tanmaatraa’, or was it created directly from
the Parameshwara? This is anirvachaneeya. It cannot be
ascertained for sure.
If you want to use the mind for maaye`va mana aadatsva – if you
want to place it in Bhagwan – you will also have to use your
buddhi to attach yourself to Him. What is the way to do this? You
have to understand that Bhagwan is the substratum of the whole
world – matshthaani sarvabhootaani. He is the cause of the
world.
Gatirbhartaa prabhuh saakshee nivaasah sharanam suhrit,
prabhavah pralayah sthaanam nidhaanam beejamavyavam.
(9. 18)
(The Supreme realm that is worth attaining, the one who sustains
and nurtures, the Master of all, the one who bestows the
auspicious and the inauspicious, the one in whom all beings stay,
the one who is worth taking refuge in, the one who benefits
without consideration of returns, the cause of every being’s birth
and death, the support of all, the one into whom all beings merge
after Dissolution, and the indestructible cause of all, is none other
than I.)
You may say that you try to attach your mind to the
Parameshwara, but it comes back to you as soon as you relax.
Very well; attach your intellect to the Parameshwara. Attaching
your buddhi to Him means seeing that Bhagwan is the matter of
which the mind is made, He is the one who supports the mind, He
354

## Page 355

is the one who shows you the mind, and He is the one who
prompts the mind. When you see everything in this light, you will
obtain paraa bhakti (supreme bhakti). Para bhakti gives the Gnan
of the essence of Bhagwan.
Bhaktyaa maamabhijaanaati yaavaanyashchaasmi tattvatah.
(18. 55)
(Through para bhakti a Yogi obtains the Gnan of My essence, and
knows Me fully.)
Either you can negate the mind through the awareness that the
Atma and the Brahman are one, or else the mind can be
subjugated to its true cause, its true support, its source of
illumination, and the power that prompts it. The mind takes refuge
in the Parameshwara – ‘Maame`kam sharanam vraja – take
refuge in Me alone.’ Therefore, aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na
kinchidapi chintaye`t – is tvam padaartha pradhaana. That
means, the emphasis is on the ‘tvam’ (‘you’ factor, in the ultimate
statement of the Vedas, that ‘Tat’ = That, the Brahman, is ‘Tvam’
= you), and there is nothing called the mind.
Mattah para tara naanyat kinchidasti dhananjaya.
(7. 7)
(O Dhananjaya, there is no cause that is separate from Me.)
Na cha matsthaani bhootaani pashya me` yogamaishvaram.
(9. 5)
(None of the beings exist in Me, but see My power of Yoga, that
even though I create all beings, My Atma is not established in
them.)
This is negating the existence of the world, through the awareness
that the Atma and the Brahman are one.

Pravachan XXVII
Gnan, Yoga and Anasakti.
Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t.
(6. 25)
(Establish your mind in Me and do not think about anything else.)
Our way of thinking has become spoilt. We think only about our
personal sorrow, personal benefit, and our own actions. We are to
withdraw from these self-centered external tendencies.
‘Aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t’ is for
achieving this.
There should be no haste in this. We have to hold on to the actions
of the mana (mind), praana (life spirit), and indreeya (senses) in a
Sattvik (of the lofty tendency) manner, and not let them get
scattered in the world. When the mind begins to do chintan
(serious thinking) we become the one who does the chintan; but
when the mind becomes the ‘I’ who gives up thinking and sits in
one body, we become the asanga drashtaa (uninvolved witness).
In Vedanta, however, ‘na kinchidapi chintaye`t’ means that we
should not think of anything – neither external nor internal. There
can be no better definition about this than the one I gave you
yesterday.
Muktaashrayam yadi nirvishayam viraktam nirvaanamrichhati
mano sahasaa yathaarthee. Chintan or achinatan – to think or not
to think? These are the two forms of the mind, but we are not the
refuge of either. Nor does the mind have any object. Furthermore,
the mind is virakta (indifferent), which means that the mind is free
of attachments and aversions. This is enough to make the mind
quiet – nirvaanmrichhati manah’.
That is excellent.
What happens when the mind is quiet? The Gita says that a
wonderful sukha (absolute happiness) rises within, when the mind
becomes quiet. Give up the subtle ego of the gye`ya (the known)
356

---

## Page 357

and the gyaataa (the knower), and remove the raaga-dve`sha
(attachment-aversion) from Gnan, and you will find that what
remains is the Paramatma. And –
Prashaantamanasam hye`nam yoginam sukhamuttamam,
upaiti shaantarajasam brahmabhootamakalmasham.
(6. 17)
(Because, the person whose mind is completely at peace is free of
sin. The Yogi, whose Rajo guna [mixed tendencies] is quieted,
obtains a deep peace because he has become one with the
Sacchidananda Brahman.)
The obstacle to brahmaananda (supreme bliss) is removed as
soon as the mind becomes quiet. Brahmananda is the natural state
of the Atma. It is experienced as soon as the blockage is removed.
There is one point in this – unless and until a person experiences
sukha, he cannot have the nirupaadhik ishtataa (the experience of
being the desired object without attributes). The phrase
‘nirupaadhik ishtataa’ is used in the Shastras. The meaning is that
what we really want is called ‘sukha’. It is not tied to any special
object. It is a personal experience.
There is, however, an element of kapata (deceit; artificiality) in
our dealings with the person we desire. We pretend to give sukha
in order to get sukha. You love your wife, saying, ‘I want to make
you happy,’ but the truth is that you want to obtain happiness
from her. It is the same with the wives who tell their husbands that
they want only his happiness. Your real intention is to get sukha,
but you pretend that you want to give it. This is an upaadhee
(superimposition).
The only desired object where no deceit is involved is the Atma.
When we desire our Self, we have no need to pretend. No maayaa
(power of delusion) is involved, no trickery, and no
superimposition of any kind. If we have any nishchhala (free of
deceit) Ishta (desires object), it is our Atma. And, when anyone
tells his desired one, ‘You are the goddess of my heart; you are
357

---

## Page 358

my all’ – whether it is for another Ishwara or another jeeva (Atma
attached to a body), it involved Maya. The only pristine Ishta is
our Atma, because it is free of all artifice. Therefore,
aatmasanstham manah kritvaa na kinchidapi chintaye`t.
Now, suppose you are at peace, and sukha has risen in your mind.
I want to draw your attention to one flaw in this. ‘Na kinchidapi
chintaye`t’ – you have stopped thinking about the world. ‘Mattah
parataram naanyat kinchidasti dhananjaya’ – nothing exists for
you, except the Paramatma. Very good. However, the delusion in
this is that as long as you sit without thinking about anything
worldly, you are in a state of Paramartha (the supreme); but you
fall from this state as soon as you resume temporal interaction.
Your Samadhi is broken. This is an obstacle in the unbroken state
of Paramartha. You are no longer the drashtaa-chaitanya (the
uninvolved witness). Your feeling of being an uninvolved witness
is gone. You should understand that this is the only point that is an
obstacle in an uninterrupted state of bliss.
So, when we put aside extraneous considerations, external
indulgences, and outward actions, we establish ourselves within,
in our own essence, and obtain the most superior state. At that
time, there is no feeling of our being the refuge of the mind, or of
the mind going to any worldly object. Nothing seems worth
attaining or giving up. We reach a state of nirvaana (being free of
the gross body) and sit in a deep Samadhi.
But, what happens when you come out of the Samadhi? You
weep! People sit in a Samadhi for six hours, and start using foul
language as soon as they emerge from it. I saw a man who
returned to worldly awareness after sitting in a Samadhi for
several hours. His eyes were red with anger. ‘What is the matter,
my brother?’ I asked.
‘I am at war with the world,’ he replied. ‘I want to fight with this
interactive world. Why does it come before me?’
Your happiness should be such that it remains with you whether
your eyes are open or shut. These foolish people say that they
have come out of the Paramartha when they emerge from their
358

---

## Page 359

Samadhi. And, they think that those who work are foolish; they
are gamblers, hypocrites and filled with sorrow. They think that
they are seated in the Paramartha and all others are gamblers.
So, what is our relationship with the form of the Paramatma that is
outside – or, is there any relationship at all? We should have
definite Gnan about this. I had told you that we have no
relationship with the external world which is known through our
senses or the antahkarana (fourfold mind). This is called
‘asangataa’. There is no such thing as any Creation that is
separate from my ‘I’ (the Atma). Only ‘I’ exists, and so it is a
mistake to imagine that there is any relationship between the
Atma and anything else. This is called ‘adviteeyataa’ – non-
duality.
‘Sanga’ means association, and sanga also means relationship.
Asangata means not being connected to anything. This is vive`ka
(discrimination; separating the Atma from everything else).
Avive`ka (lack of vivek) is removed. Then, does this interactive
world have any connection with anything else, or not? If you think
that it is connected to the Ishwara, you will have to think about
how it is connected. Consider the sansaara (interactive world) as
clay – the basic matter; and the Ishwara as the potter – the cause.
The Ishwara is the cause and also the matter of which this world is
made. Vedanta tells us that the Ishwara, and the jeevaatmaa
(Atma attached to a body) who sees the world, are essentially the
same Sat (existence), Chit (consciousness) and Anand (bliss).
That is why there is nothing called the sansara which is the same,
different, or another version of the Atma. All that is experienced
is the Atma. This is what advitiya means.
In the twelfth chapter, Bhagwan tells Arjuna –
Mayye`va mana aadhatsva mayi buddhim nive`shaya,
Nivasishyasi mayye`va ata oordhvam na sanshayah.
(12. 8)
(Attach your mind to Me, and also your intellect. Then you will
abide in Me. There is no doubt about that.)
359

## Page 360

Bhagwan is telling you to place your mind in Him. So far, there is
no difficulty. Placing your mind somewhere means to see things
with your mind molded in that form. We see the mind; but
aadhaana (placing) is when we mould our mind in a particular
form and then look at things. We do keep seeing the mind, but we
see in a particular form. Even though the form of the mind is an
imagined form, it serves to give us bhakti. It detaches the mind
from other forms.
Bhagwan is telling us, ‘Come; place your mind in Me.’ This
makes it easy for us to meditate on Him. I had recently gone to a
discourse by Guru Sharananandaji. He said that a man had asked
him to teach him how to meditate, but Swamiji refused to teach
him. Why did he refuse?
‘When you like something very much, your thoughts hover round
it automatically. You don’t need to meditate upon it. Do you need
anyone to teach you how to think about your loved ones, about
diamonds and pearls, or currency notes? Do you go anywhere to
learn how to meditate on the girl or boy with whom you have
fallen in love? Oh, when you love someone, meditation is
natural.’
Once, when I had just become a Sanyasi in 1944, I said that even
if the jeeva, the Ishwara, and the jagat (gross world) have a form,
it is the imagination of the mind. Some of the bhaktas who were
sitting there did not like my comment. Vipin Chandra Mishra –
who is a High Court Judge now – was sitting there. He was a
lawyer at that time. He got up and came to me. ‘Swamiji,’ he said,
‘all the difficulty in my saadhanaa (effort for spiritual progress)
has been removed today. I used to think that the Ishwara would
give me His darshan (vision) when He decided to Grace me. I
thought that I would not be able to see Him till then. I wasn’t even
sure whether He would ever grant me His darshan. A feeling of
helplessness made me swing between hope and despair. Now that
you have told us that we can imagine Bhagwan in our heart
whenever we want, I can get His darshan! This makes us
360

---

## Page 361

absolutely independent! Now we cannot stay without getting His
darshan! All our helplessness is over!’
I am revealing the essence of ‘Mayye`va mana aadhatsva’ to you.
Bhagwan is telling you, ‘Place your mind only in Me.’ Here, the
emphasis is on the word ‘e`va’ – ‘only’. Eva is the significant
word here; not ‘mayee’ (in Me), nor ‘aadhatsva’ (place). ‘Place
your mind only in Me.’
Had the Ishwara been far away, or had there been any delay in His
coming, had He been any other and you wanted to place your
mind in Him, you could not have done so in spite of your best
efforts. He would be far away and there would be some delay in
His coming. When you phone some Seth (wealthy businessman)
he is available sometimes, but not always. Don’t you have to wait
for him if he is in the bathroom? Sometimes, the Seth has not got
up even at eleven o’clock! So, if you have to wait for Bhagwan,
how can you place your mind in Him? And, what if He falls
asleep? Three things do not apply to Bhagwan. With Him, there is
no delay and there is no distance. Nor is He any other. Delay
means time, and distance means space. Time and space do not
affect Bhagwan; and He is no other, therefore – matter doesn’t
affect Him either.
If Bhagwan is outside your mind you will never be able to place
your mind in Him continuously. Mayye`va mana aadhatsva –
place your mind lovingly in Shri Krishna. Take refuge in Him,
who rules the whole world. Fling your mind into the sarva
(totality). The mind is like sarva – ‘Sarvam samaapnoshi tatosi
sarvah (11. 40) – You pervade the whole world, and therefore,
You are all forms.’ The mind is not a part of the viraata (the
immensity that is Creation). It is made of the pancha tanmaatraas,
and so it belongs to the virat. The entire universe is a form of the
Paramatma, so let go of your mind. Fling it into the immense
universe. It will be in the virat when it sleeps, when it is awake,
and when it dreams. Develop pre`ma (pure love) for Bhagwan,
and you will see that He stays in your heart. The antaryaami (one
361

---

## Page 362

who abides in the heart) Bhagwan is not outside the mind. He is in
the mind, and it is He who makes the mind dance.
If you keep an earthen pot tied up in a piece of cloth, the cloth will
rot and tear; but if you place a pot on clay, it can never be separate
from the clay. The principle of bhakti is that Bhagwan is
sarvaatmaa – He is the Atma of all. Bhagwan is the upaadaana
(basic matter) of the mind, so the mind cannot be separate from
Bhagwan. Bhagwan is the antaryami, so the mind cannot be
separate from Him. Bhagwan is the mind’s prakaashaka (the one
who illuminated the mind) and the mind exists only when it is
seen. The mind is seen in the light that is Bhagwan, so how can it
be separate from Him? It is He who prompts the mind, since He is
its basic matter, and He is everything.
Therefore, ‘Mayye`va mana aadhatsva’ means, ‘attach your mind
to the one who makes it dance. Merge the mind into the matter of
which it is made.’ Don’t let the mind remain separate from the
light that shows it to you. And, since it is Bhagwan who has
manifested in all forms, this mind is also Bhagwan.
However, unless you have the proper understanding, it is not
possible to place your mind in Bhagwan permanently. So, if you
understand ‘Mayye`va mana aadhatsva’, all dispute regarding
Samadhi will be over.
Nivasishyasi mayye`va ata oordhvam na sanshayah. To offer up
you mana (mind) to Bhagwan means to offer up your love. To
offer Him your buddhi means to give Him your understanding.
That means, we should think about Him and we should love Him.
Two things are required here – our thoughts and our love. As soon
as both are immersed in Him, ‘nivasishyasi mayye`va’, you will
merge into Him. You will float in Him, your interaction will be
with Him, you will eat and drink in Him, and you will sleep and
dream in Him. You will be one with Him. Therefore, the essence
of bhakti is extraordinary. It is the nature of bhakti to make the
whole world a form of Bhagwan.
Now I will tell you something else. That, which the Gita refers to
as ‘anasakti, is not restricted to any particular Varna (class of
362

---

## Page 363

society). It is not that only Brahmins should be anasakti and a
Brahmachari (celibate) should not. Anasakti means not being
‘aasakta’ (attached), not being dependent upon any object, person
or state. Lovers are called aashik-maashuk’ – this is called asakti.
To be asakta is to be an aashik (lover) – it is the same thing.
I draw your attention to one point. The group of people who are
dharmaatmaa (adhering to Dharma) show some disinclination for
anasakti. You should know the reason for this. They say that a
person should first achieve success in earning wealth and then
become anasakti. A person should work and achieve some
worldly success before moving towards anasakti.
Why should anasakti be developed first? Unless it is done this
way, people will do paapa (sinful acts) and say, ‘I am anasakta.’
They will become habitual sinners. They will accumulate wealth
by unethical means and claim to be unattached. Therefore, you
should first purify your life by doing sadhana, and then do punya
(pious deeds), but don’t be attached to them. That means, anasakti
is a superficial preamble; the main introduction is Dharma, and
anasakti comes after that. This is what the lovers of Dharma say.
I will tell you one more point. People say, ‘When we become
anasakta, good qualities will come into our lives automatically.’
We, Sadhus, think about these matters day and night. We have no
business, factory or mill to look after. The formula in this is that
people who believe the Atma to be saguna (with attributes)
believe that the Atma is full of good qualities. So, when we
become detached from the world, the good qualities will find an
outlet and flow into our life. That is why the saguna aatmavadis
are of the opinion that as soon as we give up raaga-dve`sha
(attachments-aversions) the latent virtues will manifest in our life.
Now see the principle of the nirgunavaadi (those who believe that
the Atma has no attributes). In their opinion, the Atma has no
qualities – neither good nor bad. All good and bad qualities are
inculcated through sanskaara (subtle subconscious impressions).
Therefore, you should develop good qualities through external
sanskaras, good deeds, and Dharma, through the Ashram Dharma
363

---

## Page 364

(the Dharma for your stage in life), and good habits. The wrong
tendencies will be pushed out by good ones. And, when bad
tendencies are removed there will be no need for good tendencies.
Then, your pure antahkaran will be fit to get the reflection of the
pristine Atma. Then, Brahmagnan will come and destroy agnaana
(lack of Gnan, nescience), and you will be able to obtain the
essence of the nirguna, the nitya, shuddha, buddha, mukta
(eternal, pristine, enlightened, liberated) Parameshwara.
The nirguna atmavadis say that everything that happens, or
doesn’t happen, is because of karma, or lack of karma. Even the
nature of a person is created by his actions. They believe that even
the good tendencies are the result of past good deeds. They tell us
to remove the bad tendencies by cultivating the habit of doing
good deeds. After that, we should become anasakta. The
nirgunvadis tell us to become unattached after removing the
wrong tendencies.
Vedanta, on the other hand, negates both good and bad tendencies
simultaneously. Or, it creates a clash between them, and the good
tendencies – supported by the Atma – overcome the bad ones.
Therefore, if someone tells you that you do not need to plough the
field, because good seeds will sprout regardless, they are
misguiding you. Plough the field well, my brother, put in good
fertilizers, and sow good seeds. Only then will you reap a good
crop.
People say, ‘Don’t take medicine if you are ill, because it is the
nature of the body to be healthy. The disease has come from
outside and it will go away by itself.’ No; the disease has come
from outside, so push it outside. If a thief comes into your house,
won’t you call the police to take him away? This is the opinion of
the Dharmatmas.
The intellect that tells us what is good and what is bad comes
from outside. Every thought about badness is an external
superimposition. The purpose of sadhana is to remove the faults in
us, and to inculcate good qualities. If some place is dirty, keep
washing it until all the dirt is washed away. This shows the need
364

---

## Page 365

for sadhana. It is necessary to remove the wrong tendencies that
have come into your life. They will not be removed if you ignore
them. They will remain hidden.
You may have lust, anger and greed, but feel no need to get rid of
them. You may rise above them for a while when you sit in
meditation, but they will be present when you interact in the
world. This is why the separating of Dharma and adharma (that,
which is contrary to Dharma) applies to the kartaa (doer). A
person who wants grain has to cultivate it, and a person who
wants good qualities has to give up wrong tendencies and
cultivate good ones. Otherwise, the method of Advaita Vedanta
(that nothing exists except the non-dual Brahman) will be lost,
and lesser philosophies will be accepted. People believe some
religious Sect to be the ultimate goal, some place of worship to be
the ultimate destination, and a waiting room to be their home.
These people do not try to remove bad tendencies by inculcating
good ones.
Kaama na chhoda, krodha na chhodaa, naamajapana kyon
chhoda diyaa?
(You didn’t give up lust, nor did you give up anger; why did you
give up chanting Bhagwan’s name?)
It must be kept in mind that the wrong tendencies must be known
to be wrong, and there must be a resolve to give them up. A
sincere effort must be made to implement this resolve. Along with
that, you must understand what is good, and make a resolve to
inculcate good tendencies in your life, and sustain them. Where it
is a question of Dharma-adharma, inculcate the right sanskaras in
your life through proper actions. Only then will the mind get the
correct sanskaras. If you do not accept being the karta,
considering yourself to be the akartaa (not the doer), the result
will be that you won’t be able to do any good deeds; but the bad
habits will continue. The wrong tendencies come into us because
of wrong actions, by looking at improper things, reading improper
365

---

## Page 366

material, etc. To get rid of them it is necessary to cultivate new
and good habits.
I will now tell you about another saadhan (effort for spiritual
progress). If you want to spoil the natural form of any object on
the strength of sadhana, it cannot be done. Your sadhan will be
wasted. For example, if you say, ‘Others see through their eyes; I
will see through my ears,’ that can never happen. If even the
Ishwara wants you to hear something, it will be through your ears.
If He wants you to see something, it will be through your eyes,
and if He wants you to taste something, it will be through your
tongue. Even the Ishwara does not change the natural order of
things. Therefore, only the bad tendencies that have some from
outside can be removed and only good tendencies should be
brought into our lives. There is no good or bad in the main object.
And so, my brother, you have been given eyes to see with, ears to
hear with, a nose to smell with, and a tongue to taste with. Don’t
try to make changes in them.
Indriyasye`ndriyaarsyaarthe` raaga-dve`shau vyavasthitau,
tayorna vashamaagachhe`ttau hyasya paripanthinau.
(3. 34)
(Raga-dvesha are hidden in all five senses. A human should not be
ruled by them, because attachments and aversions create obstacles
on the path to the Paramartha.)
You should not be ruled by raga-dvesha. Whatever task you wish
to do, you should be free of attachments and aversions. It is
abhinive`sha (identification with the body) that rouses us into
doing things. Anger does not come unless there is some desire.
We want something or another, and we get angry when things go
contrary to our wishes. Nobody indulges in promiscuity unless
they have lust. Some people believe themselves to be asanga, and
go on doing all kinds of immoral things. Their asangataa (non-
attachment) is false. Why would anyone do anything that is
contrary to Dharma unless he was driven by desire? Nobody tells
366

---

## Page 367

lies for no reason. We have to be alert that such false asangata, or
anasakti, does not come into our life. Don’t fall into the habit of
paying lip service to the principles of righteousness.
No matter how much sadhana you do, your body will always be
made of bones, flesh and skin. Don’t desire changes in natural
objects. Your ears will hear and your eyes will see. But, if you do
your work prompted by attachments and aversions, desires and
anger, etc, then you are driven by pride. If you actions are
prompted by the Ishwara, you are indeed an akarta. This is what
you have to observe. The Gita shows you how to analyze all this.
Om Shantih Shantih Shantih.
