# ===== Environment Variables (example) =====
# Copy this file to `.env.local` for local development.
# In production on Vercel, set the same variables in Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables.

# --- Vercel Project Identification ---
# Used when interacting with the Vercel REST API (e.g., listing deployments, creating env vars via API,
# scripting CI automations). Not required for normal Next.js runtime.
# Safe to share; it is NOT a secret. You will still need a `VERCEL_TOKEN` for authenticated API calls.
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_ymD2jeWiWhbTrxDvLfKV4gdgd8qD

# Optional: only if you need to read the Project ID in the browser (client-side).
# Avoid exposing secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables; this specific ID is fine to expose.
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_ymD2jeWiWhbTrxDvLfKV4gdgd8qD

# If you plan to call the Vercel API from server-side scripts, you will also need:
# VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_api_token
# VERCEL_ORG_ID=team_or_org_id

# Usage in server code (Node/Next.js):
#   const projectId = process.env.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID;
# Usage in client code (browser):
#   const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_PROJECT_ID;
