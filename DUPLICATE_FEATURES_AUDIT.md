## Overview
- **Goal**: Identify duplicate/overlapping features for consolidation.
- **Highlights**:
  - Pages/UI: multiple versions for conferences, drafts, games, hero.
  - API routes: parallel endpoints with different response shapes.
  - Services/config: several Appwrite clients/configs.
  - Types: duplicated `Game`, fragmented `Player` models.
  - Scoring: logic duplicated across TS (inline and modular) and Python.
  - Service worker: duplicate registration/manager paths.

## Pages and UI

### Conference Showcase (2 versions)
- **Paths**:
  - `components/ConferenceShowcase.tsx`
  - `app/conference-showcase/page.tsx`
- **Similarities**: Power 4 presentation; calls `/api/bigten`, `/api/big12`, `/api/sec`, `/api/acc`; uses `getTeamColors`.
- **Differences**:
  - `components/ConferenceShowcase.tsx`: Fetches teams and players for all four conferences; sorts top players; static fallbacks; richer layout.
  - `app/conference-showcase/page.tsx`: Big Ten + SEC focused; heavy visuals; many debug logs. Link to `/conference-showcase-2` removed.

### Draft Pages (current)
- **Paths**:
  - `app/draft/[leagueId]/page.tsx`
  - `app/draft/[leagueId]/draft-board/page.tsx` (redirects to canonical)
  - `app/draft/[leagueId]/realtime/page.tsx` (canonical)
  - `app/draft/mock/page.tsx`
- **Similarities**: Draft UI with filters, timers, pick flow; reuse of components (`DraftBoard`, `DraftOrder`, `DraftTimer`).
- **Notes**:
  - `[leagueId]/page.tsx`: Redirects to canonical realtime draft room.
  - `[leagueId]/draft-board/page.tsx`: Redirects to canonical draft room.
  - `[leagueId]/realtime/page.tsx`: Canonical live draft; `useDraftRealtime`, `ProjectionsService.searchPlayers()`.
  - `mock/page.tsx`: Simulates draft using `/api/draft/players`.

### Games UI (2 approaches)
- **Paths**:
  - Old: `components/GamesList.tsx` using `lib/api.ts`
  - New: `components/features/games/GamesGrid.tsx`, `components/features/games/GameCard.tsx`, `lib/hooks/useGames.ts`, `lib/api/games.ts`, `lib/api/client.ts`
- **Similarities**: Grid/list of games; eligibility highlighting; loading/error states.
- **Differences**:
  - Old stack: ad-hoc API wrapper `lib/api.ts` and inline types; manual date formatting.
  - New stack: typed `APIClient`, modular `gamesAPI`, shared `types/game.ts`, reusable UI components.

### Hero Section (duplicated)
- **Paths**:
  - `components/HeroSection.tsx`
  - `components/layouts/HeroSection.tsx`
- **Similarities**: Identical JSX/styling.
- **Differences**: Only the file location differs.

### League Overview vs League Portal
- **Paths**:
  - `app/league/[leagueId]/page.tsx`
  - `components/LeaguePortal.tsx`
- **Similarities**: Multi-tab dashboard; conference/players displays; quick stats/standings widgets.
- **Differences**:
  - League page fetches via Appwrite SDK (`databases.*`) with live collections.
  - LeaguePortal fetches through `/api/leagues/[leagueId]` and conference endpoints; includes mock teams and more marketing-style overview.

## API Routes

### Draftable Players Endpoint (consolidated)
- **Paths**:
  - `app/api/draft/players/route.ts` (canonical)
- **Status**: Legacy `app/api/players/draftable/route.ts` removed. All UIs should call `/api/draft/players`.

### Leagues Endpoints (mixed patterns)
- **Paths**:
  - Cookie+REST: `app/api/leagues/create/route.ts`, `app/api/leagues/my-leagues/route.ts`
  - SDK: `app/api/leagues/search/route.ts`
- **Similarities**: Create/search/list user leagues; pagination/filters.
- **Differences**:
  - Cookie+REST uses direct Appwrite REST with `fetch` and session cookie.
  - SDK route uses `node-appwrite`. Response field names vary (`mode/conf` vs `gameMode/selectedConference`).

### Auth Endpoints (mixed patterns) ‚è≥ In progress
- **Paths**:
  - Email/password: `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/user/route.ts`, `app/api/auth/update-profile/route.ts`
  - OAuth: `app/api/auth/oauth/*`
  - Legacy browser helper: `js/appwrite-browser.js` (references `/api/auth/proxy` which is not present)
- **Similarities**: Normalize Appwrite auth behind Next routes; manage `appwrite-session` cookie.
- **Differences**:
  - Mix of direct REST calls with cookie plumbing vs SDK elsewhere; missing `/api/auth/proxy` referenced by the browser script.

### Projections (consolidated)
- **Paths**:
  - Endpoint: `app/api/projections/route.ts`
  - Service: `lib/services/projections.service.ts` (canonical)
- **Status**: `lib/services/cfb-projections.service.ts` deleted. All projection logic consolidated, with model inputs (depth, pace, pass/rush, ratings, ADP).

## Services and Config

### Appwrite Client/Config Duplication
- **Paths**:
  - Configs: `lib/appwrite-config.ts`, `lib/config/appwrite.config.ts`, `appwrite.config.json`, `scripts/sync-appwrite-config.js`
  - Clients: `lib/appwrite.ts`, `lib/appwrite-server.ts`, `lib/appwrite-client-fix.ts`, `js/appwrite-browser.js`
- **Similarities**: Initialize Appwrite clients; export databases/collections.
- **Differences**:
  - Multiple sources of truth for endpoint/project/database/collections; some hardcoded vs env-driven; different `COLLECTIONS` maps and `REALTIME_CHANNELS` duplicated.

### HTTP API Clients (2)
- **Paths**:
  - New: `lib/api/client.ts` (+ resource modules like `lib/api/games.ts`)
  - Old: `lib/api.ts`
- **Similarities**: Wrap HTTP requests to app backend.
- **Differences**: New client has typed errors, timeouts, and modular resource APIs; old client embeds types and endpoints inline.

## Types and Models

### Game Type Duplicated
- **Paths**:
  - Shared: `types/game.ts`
  - Local duplicate: `app/league/[leagueId]/page.tsx` (redeclares the same interface)
- **Impact**: Risk of drift if fields change; prefer importing shared type.

### Player Types Fragmented
- **Paths**:
  - Fantasy player model: `types/player.types.ts`
  - Draft UI model: `types/draft.ts` (includes a different `Player` interface)
  - Projection model: `types/projections.ts`
- **Impact**: Multiple overlapping `Player` shapes complicate reuse across endpoints/UIs.

## Scoring Logic
- **Paths**:
  - Inline calc: `app/api/cron/weekly-scoring/route.ts` (local `calculateFantasyPoints`)
  - Modular TS: `live-scoring-mechanics/scoring-system/ppr-scoring.ts` (`ScoringCalculator` with settings/bonuses)
  - Python: `scoring.py`, `scoring_example.py`
- **Impact**: Multiple sources of scoring truth across languages; risk of inconsistency.

## Service Worker
- **Paths**:
  - Script: `public/service-worker.js`
  - Inline registration: `app/layout.tsx`
  - Manager: `lib/service-worker.js`
- **Similarities**: Register `/service-worker.js`, handle updates/offline notifications.
- **Differences**: Two separate registration paths (inline vs manager). Manager posts messages not handled by SW script.

## Miscellaneous
- **Non-existent route cleanup**:
  - `/conference-showcase-2` links removed.
- **Test/Debug Pages**:
  - `app/test-cors/page.tsx`: CORS testing utility (should be removed in production)
  - `test-account-settings.js`: Test script (should be in tests folder)

## Highest-Impact Hotspots
- **Draft data and UIs**: Consolidate on one API shape and primary draft experience; deprecate others.
- **Appwrite client/config**: Reduce to one frontend client + one server client and a single `COLLECTIONS` map.
- **Projections**: Unify service usage and data shapes across UI and endpoint.
- **Games API client**: Keep `lib/api/client.ts` + resource modules; retire `lib/api.ts` usages.
- **Service worker**: Pick one registration approach and align message contract.
- **Types**: Import shared `types/game.ts` everywhere; standardize `Player` shape or add converters.
- **Conference endpoints**: Normalize responses consistently across all four.
