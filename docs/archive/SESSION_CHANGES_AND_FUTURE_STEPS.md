# Session Changes and Future Steps

## üìÖ Today's Session Changes (August 14, 2025)

### üîß Technical Fixes

#### 1. **Fixed createSessionClient Import Error** (12:52 PM)
- **Problem**: `createSessionClient` was not exported from `lib/appwrite-server.ts`
- **Solution**: Moved function to `lib/auth-utils.ts` and properly exported it
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `lib/auth-utils.ts` - Added createSessionClient function
  - `app/api/sync/route.ts` - Updated import path

#### 2. **Fixed Locker Room 401 Authorization Error** (1:05 PM)
- **Problem**: Client-side Appwrite calls were failing with 401 unauthorized
- **Solution**: Created server-side API route to handle authentication
- **Files Created**: 
  - `app/api/leagues/[leagueId]/locker-room/route.ts`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/league/[leagueId]/locker-room/page.tsx` - Switched to API fetch

#### 3. **Resolved is-commissioner 404 Error** (1:10 PM)
- **Problem**: API route existed but wasn't being found
- **Solution**: Route was already correctly placed at `/api/leagues/is-commissioner/[leagueId]/route.ts`
- **Status**: Working correctly after deployment

## üîÑ Data Flow Updates

### New API Routes Added:
1. `/api/leagues/[leagueId]/locker-room` - Comprehensive locker room data

### Authentication Flow Updated:
- Locker room now uses server-side authentication
- All sensitive operations moved to API routes
- Session validation happens server-side

### Caching Strategy:
- Need to implement proper caching for:
  - Player data (1 hour TTL)
  - League data (5 minute TTL)
  - Rankings (6 hour TTL)

## üí° Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with Quick Wins**:
   - Enable Vercel Analytics (5 mins)
   - Enable Appwrite Realtime (30 mins)
   - Add success toasts (15 mins)

2. **Focus on User Experience**:
   - Fix commissioner settings saving
   - Add loading states everywhere
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Monetization Priority**:
   - Get one AI feature working (Claude draft assistant)
   - Use it as premium feature demo
   - Start building subscription tiers

4. **Technical Debt**:
   - Re-enable all TypeScript strict checks
   - Add comprehensive error boundaries
   - Implement proper logging with Sentry

## üìù Notes for Next Developer

1. **Environment Variables**: All properly set in Vercel
2. **Deployment**: Use `vercel --prod` for production deploys
3. **Testing**: Test locker room with user account before deploying
4. **API Keys**: Never expose in client code, use server routes
5. **Playwright Issue**: Need to use Node.js runtime for Rotowire scraping

## üö® Critical Items

1. **Security**: Add GitHub secrets for workflows (still pending)
2. **Performance**: Implement proper caching strategy
3. **Monitoring**: Set up Sentry error tracking
4. **Documentation**: Keep updating as changes are made
