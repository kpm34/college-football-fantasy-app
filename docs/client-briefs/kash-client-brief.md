# Client Brief

## About
- Who: Kash, founder and product lead of CFB Fantasy; product strategist building a modern college fantasy experience
- Business: A product-led platform that makes conference-based and Power 4-based college fantasy simple, engaging, and manageable on any device, with fun interactive content and features to personalize the fantasy experience.
- Product/Service: Cross-platform app: draft rooms (snake & auction), live scoring, trades; league home; player projections & rankings; fantasy mascot design studio. Built for casual and diehard fans to create a fun, interactive service that brings people together to bond over college football.

## Context
- Discovery: Primarily social and content, then word-of-mouth and group chats; goal to reach influencers, NIL athlete partnerships, podcasts, college orgs, and alumni groups.
- Devices: mobile, desktop
- Audience: Alumni and student groups; office and coworker leagues; content-driven fans who follow recruiting and rankings. Onboarding aims to be low-friction for casual players. Non-technical guardrails; intuitive, reliable; draft rooms that don't glitch.
- User Needs: Social, low-friction play; content-driven engagement; intuitive onboarding; stability.
- Competitors: Fantrax (we set a much higher UX bar); content vibe: Pardon My Take / Barstool Sports.

## Goals
- Expectations: Blend content (video + articles) with fast, cutting-edge UI and informative tools to make gameplay effortless; launch a Pro tier featuring custom projection interface with a 3D mascot builder for competitive leagues; enhance personalization; drive year-over-year retention by persisting history (head-to-head rivals, season archives, trophy room, streaks); social hooks to make returning each season a no-brainer. Prioritize speed, stability, legibility; mobile-first; crash-free and intuitive for casual players while powerful for veterans. Key flows (create league, join, draft, set lineup, waivers, scoreboard) must be obvious and zero-friction with contextual guidance.
- CTA Triggers: Weekly cadence — set lineup, make waiver claim, review updated projections, view/change trade proposals.
- Look & Feel: Micro-interactions (draft pick confirm), touchdown moments, rivalry wins confetti; 3D mascot; never expensive; prioritize speed and performance.

## Deliverables
- Essential Pages: Home/landing (explain modes, value prop, latest, contact); Dashboard (all leagues/teams + quick actions); League Home (overview, standings, schedule, news, activity); Draft Room (snake/auction, auto-pick, queue, projections); Locker Room (set lineup, review injuries, projections, news inline); Waivers (claims, budget, priority, results); Live Scores (real-time college stats & fantasy); League Scoreboard (weekly H2H updates in real-time); History (H2H history, all-time rankings, trophy room lore).
- Competition Look: Sleeper-like polish, mobile-friendly.
- Key Differentiators: Mobile-first speed; offline resilience for draft/lineup; frictionless onboarding; mock draft; transparent scoring rules.
- Works / Not: Working — create league, homepage, dashboard, commissioner settings. In development — locker room flow, projections, live scoring pipeline, studio. Yet to begin — injury/news integration, live scoring of games, history artifacts, drafting.
