# Diagrams Guide

## Move or update outdated or misplaced diagrams
- Use the plan/apply script (see Index section) to move duplicates and outdated files.
- Project-map entries that donâ€™t render should be regenerated or moved to `functional-flow/` or `system-architecture/`.
- Prefer lightweight `.md` Mermaid. Mix Draw.io (`.drawio`) and Excalidraw (`.excalidraw`) when clarity requires.

## Remove duplicates
- Keep one canonical copy under `docs/diagrams/`.
- For renamed/moved diagrams, leave a short stub pointing to the new path.

## What goes where
- functional-flow/: user flows (signup, join league, create league, draft)
- project-map/: per-route and per-module maps of the repo
- system-architecture/: end-to-end data flow, projections, realtime, background jobs
- public/: assets exported for docs or blog

## Conventions
- Filenames: kebab-case, short, specific (e.g., `join-league.md`)
- Versions: append `-v2`, `-2025-09-01` if materially different
- Frontmatter (optional): title, updated, source

## Index (auto-generated by script)
- Run: `npm run diagrams:plan` to preview moves and `npm run diagrams:apply` to apply.
- The script writes an inventory to `docs/diagrams/_inventory.json` and updates this README list.
