# User Journeys — Formatting Standard

All journey diagrams should:
- Flow left‑to‑right (`flowchart LR`)
- Include a small legend showing terminator, decision, and process
- Use the standard classes:
  - `terminator`: blue rounded pill
  - `decision`: purple diamond
  - `process`: neutral rectangle
- Keep total diagram under ~120 lines

See: `user-journeys:auth-user-flow` for the base example.
