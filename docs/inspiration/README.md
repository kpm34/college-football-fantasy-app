# Inspiration Capture

- Add URLs (one per line) to `urls.txt` in this folder.
- Run: `npm run design:capture`
- Outputs:
  - `screenshots/` full-page PNGs
  - `data/` JSON summaries (colors, fonts, features)
  - `summaries/` Markdown briefs ready to paste into AI prompts

Tips:
- Prefer pages with strong hierarchy, motion, or 3D use.
- Capture both desktop and mobile views (change `--width`/`--height`).
- Use small batches (3â€“10 URLs) for quick loops.
