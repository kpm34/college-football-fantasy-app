## üîë Key Architectural Decisions

### Repository Pattern
- All database operations go through repositories
- Consistent error handling and type safety
- Easy to mock for testing

### Platform-First Approach
- Leverage Vercel Edge Functions for <50ms responses
- Use Appwrite Realtime for live updates
- KV caching for frequently accessed data

### Schema Management
- `appwrite.config.json` as single source of truth
- Automated type generation
- CI/CD checks for schema drift

## üìà Performance Metrics
- **API Response Time**: <200ms average
- **Draft Updates**: <100ms with Realtime
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ~80% for player data
- **Build Time**: ~90 seconds on Vercel

## üêõ Known Issues
1. **Local Development**: Node.js v22 compatibility issues with Next.js 15
   - Workaround: Use Node.js v20 or deploy directly to Vercel

2. **Draft Player Count**: Currently showing limited players
   - Fix deployed: Removed 1000 player limit, improved filtering

3. **Projections Accuracy**: Basic calculations need refinement
   - Next priority for development

## üöÄ Deployment
- **Production URLs**: 
  - Primary: https://cfbfantasy.app
  - Secondary: https://collegefootballfantasy.app
- **Preview Deployments**: Automatic on PR
- **Environment**: Vercel Edge Network
