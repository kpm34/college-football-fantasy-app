# Project Map Diagrams (Archived)

These diagrams were moved from docs/diagrams/project-map to ops/attic/diagrams/project-map as part of the consolidation plan.

Refer to the new canonical diagram structure under:
- docs/diagrams/draft/ (organized by overview, user-flow, data-and-er, api-and-events)
- docs/diagrams/site map/ (current site maps)

If you need a diagram that isn't yet merged into the new set, pull it from this attic and re-author it to meet the new diagram size and naming conventions.
