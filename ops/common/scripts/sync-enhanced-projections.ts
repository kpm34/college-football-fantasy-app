/**
 * ❌ DEPRECATED: Sync Enhanced Projections Script
 * 
 * This script is deprecated as of August 17, 2025.
 * Enhanced projections are now calculated on-demand in the draft API
 * with proper depth chart multipliers applied in real-time.
 * 
 * The projections logic has been moved to:
 * - /app/api/draft/players/route.ts (with depth chart logic)
 * - /scripts/ingestDepthCharts.ts (for depth chart updates)
 * 
 * No separate sync is needed - projections are calculated on-the-fly!
