## 🎯 The One Thing

If we do nothing else this month, we must:

**"Launch a working draft room with AI recommendations that makes users say 'Wow, this is actually helpful!'"**

Everything else is secondary to this goal.

## 📝 Notes

- **Focus on VALUE**: Every feature must directly help users win their league
- **Ship FAST**: Better to have something working than something perfect
- **Listen to USERS**: Their feedback trumps our assumptions
- **Monitor COSTS**: Keep AI usage sustainable
- **Have FUN**: We're building something cool!

Remember: We have premium tools, but success comes from execution, not technology. Let's ship! 🚀
